abstract = {Over the past decade, a growing community of researchers has emerged around the use of constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) methods to simulate, analyze and predict a variety of metabolic phenotypes using genome-scale models. The COBRA Toolbox, a MATLAB package for implementing COBRA methods, was presented earlier. Here we present a substantial update of this in silico toolbox. Version 2.0 of the COBRA Toolbox expands the scope of computations by including in silico analysis methods developed since its original release. New functions include (i) network gap filling, (ii) (13)C analysis, (iii) metabolic engineering, (iv) omics-guided analysis and (v) visualization. As with the first version, the COBRA Toolbox reads and writes systems biology markup language-formatted models. In version 2.0, we improved performance, usability and the level of documentation. A suite of test scripts can now be used to learn the core functionality of the toolbox and validate results. This toolbox lowers the barrier of entry to use powerful COBRA methods.},

abstract = {The use of computational modeling to describe and analyze biological
systems is at the heart of systems biology. Model structures, simulation
descriptions and numerical results can be encoded in structured formats,
but there is an increasing need to provide an additional semantic
layer. Semantic information adds meaning to components of structured
descriptions to help identify and interpret them unambiguously. Ontologies
are one of the tools frequently used for this purpose. We describe
here three ontologies created specifically to address the needs of
the systems biology community. The Systems Biology Ontology (SBO)
provides semantic information about the model compo- nents. The Kinetic
Simulation Algorithm Ontology (KiSAO) supplies information about
existing algorithms available for the simulation of systems biology
models, their characterization and interrelationships. The Terminology
for the Description of Dynamics (TEDDY) categorizes dynamical features
of the simulation results and general systems behavior. The provision
of semantic information extends a model’s longevity and facilitates
its reuse. It provides useful insight into the biology of modeled
processes, and may be used to make informed decisions on subsequent
simulation experiments.},

abstract = {Improvements in biological data acquisition and genomes sequencing
now allow to reconstruct entire metabolic networks of many living
organisms. The size and complexity of these networks prohibit manual
drawing and thereby urge the need of dedicated visualization techniques.
An efficient representation of such a network should preserve the
topological information of metabolic pathways while respecting biological
drawing conventions. These constraints complicate the automatic generation
of such visualization as it raises graph drawing issues.

In this paper we propose a method to lay out the entire metabolic
network while preserving the pathway informa- tion as much as possible.
That method is flexible as it enables the user to define whether
or not node duplication should be performed, to preserve or not the
network topology. Our technique combines partitioning, node place-
ment and edge bundling to provide a pseudo-orthogonal visualization
of the metabolic network. To ease pathway information retrieval,
we also provide complementary interaction tools that emphasize relevant
pathways in the entire metabolic context.},

@article{Liebermeister06,
abstract = {Background: Translating a known metabolic network into a dynamic model
requires rate laws for all chemical reactions. The mathematical expressions
depend on the underlying enzymatic mechanism; they can become quite
involved and may contain a large number of parameters. Rate laws
and enzyme parameters are still unknown for most enzymes.


Results: We introduce a simple and general rate law called "convenience
kinetics". It can be derived from a simple random-order enzyme mechanism.
Thermodynamic laws can impose dependencies on the kinetic parameters.
Hence, to facilitate model fitting and parameter optimisation for
large networks, we introduce thermodynamically independent system
parameters: their values can be varied independently, without violating
thermodynamical constraints. We achieve this by expressing the equilibrium
constants either by Gibbs free energies of formation or by a set
of independent equilibrium constants. The remaining system parameters
are mean turnover rates, generalised Michaelis-Menten constants,
and constants for inhibition and activation. All parameters correspond
to molecular energies, for instance, binding energies between reactants
and enzyme.


Conclusion: Convenience kinetics can be used to translate a biochemical
network – manually or automatically - into a dynamical model with
plausible biological properties. It implements enzyme saturation
and regulation by activators and inhibitors, covers all possible
reaction stoichiometries, and can be specified by a small number
of parameters. Its mathematical form makes it especially suitable
for parameter estimation and optimisation. Parameter estimates can
be easily computed from a least-squares fit to Michaelis-Menten values,
turnover rates, equilibrium constants, and other quantities that
are routinely measured in enzyme assays and stored in kinetic databases.},

@article{Klamt07,
abstract = {Background: Mathematical modelling of cellular networks is an integral
part of Systems Biology and requires appropriate software tools.
An important class of methods in Systems Biology deals with structural
or topological (parameter-free) analysis of cellular networks. So
far, software tools providing such methods for both mass-flow (metabolic)
as well as signal-flow (signalling and regulatory) networks are lacking.


Results: Herein we introduce CellNetAnalyzer, a toolbox for MATLAB
facilitating, in an interactive and visual manner, a comprehensive
structural analysis of metabolic, signalling and regulatory networks.
The particular strengths of CellNetAnalyzer are methods for functional
network analysis, i.e. for characterising functional states, for
detecting functional dependencies, for identifying intervention strategies,
or for giving qualitative predictions on the effects of perturbations.
CellNetAnalyzer extends its predecessor FluxAnalyzer (originally
developed for metabolic network and pathway analysis) by a new modelling
framework for examining signal-flow networks. Two of the novel methods
implemented in CellNetAnalyzer are discussed in more detail regarding
algorithmic issues and applications: the computation and analysis
(i) of shortest positive and shortest negative paths and circuits
in interaction graphs and (ii) of minimal intervention sets in logical
networks.


Conclusion: CellNetAnalyzer provides a single suite to perform structural
and qualitative analysis of both mass-flow- and signal-flow-based
cellular networks in a user-friendly environment. It provides a large
toolbox with various, partially unique, functions and algorithms
for functional network analysis. CellNetAnalyzer is freely available
for academic use.},

@article{Singh2006,
abstract = {Background: Targeting persistent tubercule bacilli has become an important challenge in the development of anti-tuberculous drugs. As the glyoxylate bypass is essential for persistent bacilli, interference with it holds the potential for designing new antibacterial drugs. We have developed kinetic models of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glyoxylate bypass in Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and studied the effects of inhibition of various enzymes in the M. tuberculosis model. Results: We used E. coli to validate the pathway-modeling protocol and showed that changes in metabolic flux can be estimated from gene expression data. The M. tuberculosis model reproduced the observation that deletion of one of the two isocitrate lyase genes has little effect on bacterial growth in macrophages, but deletion of both genes leads to the elimination of the bacilli from the lungs. It also substantiated the inhibition of isocitrate lyases by 3-nitropropionate. On the basis of our simulation studies, we propose that: (i) fractional inactivation of both isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 is required for a flux through the glyoxylate bypass in persistent mycobacteria; and (ii) increasing the amount of active isocitrate dehydrogenases can stop the flux through the glyoxylate bypass, so the kinase that inactivates isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and/or the proposed inactivator of isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 is a potential target for drugs against persistent mycobacteria. In addition, competitive inhibition of isocitrate lyases along with a reduction in the inactivation of isocitrate dehydrogenases appears to be a feasible strategy for targeting persistent mycobacteria. Conclusion: We used kinetic modeling of biochemical pathways to assess various potential anti-tuberculous drug targets that interfere with the glyoxylate bypass flux, and indicated the type of inhibition needed to eliminate the pathogen. The advantage of such an approach to the assessment of drug targets is that it facilitates the study of systemic effect(s) of the modulation of the target enzyme(s) in the cellular environment.},

Many algorithms which render an abstract graph structure as a diagram are valued for their conformance to aesthetic criteria (e.g. reducing the number of edge crossings, maximising symmetry), or for computational efficiency. They are not usually judged on their ability to produce diagrams that maximise human performance. This paper presents the results of experiments investigating the relative worth (from an HCI point of view) of graph drawing aesthetics and algorithms using a single graph. The results indicate that while some individual aesthetics affect human performance, it is difficult to say that one algorithm is `better' than another from a relational understanding point of view. Designers of automatic layout algorithms, and the systems which embody such algorithms, can benefit from this study and this human-centred approach, by adapting their methods to focus on user concerns, rather than computational ones.},

abstract = {Motivation: Structural studies of metabolic networks yield deeper
insight into topology, functionality and capabilities of the metabolisms
of different organisms. Here, we address the analysis of potential
failure modes in metabolic networks whose occurrence will render
the network structurally incap- able of performing certain functions.
Such studies will help to identify crucial parts in the network structure
and to find suitable targets for repressing undesired metabolic functions.



Results: We introduce the concept of minimal cut sets for biochemical
networks. A minimal cut set (MCS) is a minimal (irreducible) set
of reactions in the network whose inactiva- tion will definitely
lead to a failure in certain network functions. We present an algorithm
which enables the computation of the MCSs in a given network related
to user-defined object- ive reactions. This algorithm operates on
elementary modes. A number of potential applications are outlined,
including net- work verifications, phenotype predictions, assessing
structural robustness and fragility, metabolic flux analysis and
target identification in drug discovery. Applications are illustrated
by the MCSs in the central metabolism of Escherichia coli for growth
on different substrates.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Yarrowia lipolytica is an oleaginous yeast which has emerged
as an important microorganism for several biotechnological processes,
such as the production of organic acids, lipases and proteases. It
is also considered a good candidate for single-cell oil production.
Although some of its metabolic pathways are well studied, its metabolic
engineering is hindered by the lack of a genome-scale model that
integrates the current knowledge about its metabolism.RESULTS:Combining
in silico tools and expert manual curation, we have produced an accurate
genome-scale metabolic model for Y. lipolytica. Using a scaffold
derived from a functional metabolic model of the well-studied but
phylogenetically distant yeast S. cerevisiae, we mapped conserved
reactions, rewrote gene associations, added species-specific reactions
and inflected specialized copies of scaffold reactions to account
for species-specific expansion of protein families. We used physiological
measures obtained under lab conditions to validate our predictions.CONCLUSIONS:Y.
lipolytica iNL895represents the first well-annotated metabolic model
of an oleaginous yeast, providing a reference for future metabolic
improvement, and a starting point for the metabolic reconstruction
of other species in the Yarrowia clade and other oleaginous yeasts.},

These include signaling, gene regulatory, and metabolic networks. However, most of these models are specific to each kind of network. Their interconnection demands a whole-cell modeling framework for a complete understanding of cellular systems. We describe the features required by an integrated framework for modeling, analyzing and simulating biological processes, and review several modeling formalisms that have been used in Systems Biology including Boolean networks, Bayesian networks, Petri nets, process algebras, constraint-based models, differential equations, rule-based models, interacting state machines, cellular automata, and agent-based models. We compare the features provided by different formalisms, and discuss recent approaches in the integration of these formalisms, as well as possible directions for the future.},

@article{Waltemath11SedML,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:The increasing use of computational simulation experiments
to inform modern biological research creates new challenges to annotate,
archive, share and reproduce such experiments. The recently published
Minimum Information About a Simulation Experiment (MIASE) proposes
a minimal set of information that should be provided to allow the
reproduction of simulation experiments among users and software tools.RESULTS:In
this article, we present the Simulation Experiment Description Markup
Language (SED-ML). SED-ML encodes in a computer-readable exchange
format the information required by MIASE to enable reproduction of
simulation experiments. It has been developed as a community project
and it is defined in a detailed technical specification and additionally
provides an XML schema. The version of SED-ML described in this publication
is Level 1 Version 1. It covers the description of the most frequent
type of simulation experiments in the area, namely time course simulations.
SED-ML documents specify which models to use in an experiment, modifications
to apply on the models before using them, which simulation procedures
to run on each model, what analysis results to output, and how the
results should be presented. These descriptions are independent of
the underlying model implementation. SED-ML is a software-independent
format for encoding the description of simulation experiments; it
is not specific to particular simulation tools. Here, we demonstrate
that with the growing software support for SED-ML we can effectively
exchange executable simulation descriptions.CONCLUSIONS:With SED-ML,
software can exchange simulation experiment descriptions, enabling
the validation and reuse of simulation experiments in different tools.
Authors of papers reporting simulation experiments can make their
simulation protocols available for other scientists to reproduce
the results. Because SED-ML is agnostic about exact modeling language(s)
used, experiments covering models from different fields of research
can be accurately described and combined.},

@incollection{Wagner12,
abstract = {Since the last decade of the twentieth century, systems biology has
gained the ability to study the structure and function of genome-scale
metabolic networks. These are systems of hundreds to thousands of
chemical reactions that sustain life. Most of these reactions are
catalyzed by enzymes which are encoded by genes. A metabolic network
extracts chemical elements and energy from the environment, and converts
them into forms that the organism can use. The function of a whole
metabolic network constrains evolutionary changes in its parts. I
will discuss here three classes of such changes, and how they are
constrained by the function of the whole. These are the accumulation
of amino acid changes in enzyme-coding genes, duplication of enzyme-coding
genes, and changes in the regulation of enzymes. Conversely, evolutionary
change in network parts can alter the function of the whole network.
I will discuss here two such changes, namely the elimination of reactions
from a metabolic network through loss of function mutations in enzyme-coding
genes, and the addition of metabolic reactions, for example through
mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer. Reaction addition also
provides a window into the evolution of metabolic innovations, the
ability of a metabolism to sustain life on new sources of energy
and of chemical elements.},

We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery.},

source of cellulases and hemicellulases harnessed for the hydrolysis
of biomass to simple sugars, which can then be con- verted to biofuels
such as ethanol and other chemicals. The highly productive strains
in use today were generated by classical mu- tagenesis. To learn
how cellulase production was improved by these techniques, we performed
massively parallel sequencing to identify mutations in the genomes
of two hyperproducing strains (NG14, and its direct improved descendant,
RUT C30). We detected a surprisingly high number of mutagenic events:
223 single nucle- otides variants, 15 small deletions or insertions,
and 18 larger dele- tions, leading to the loss of more than 100 kb
of genomic DNA. From these events, we report previously undocumented
non-synonymous mutations in 43 genes that are mainly involved in
nuclear transport, mRNA stability, transcription, secretion/vacuolar
targeting, and me- tabolism. This homogeneity of functional categories
suggests that multiple changes are necessary to improve cellulase
production and not simply a few clear-cut mutagenic events. Phenotype
microarrays show that some of these mutations result in strong changes
in the carbon assimilation pattern of the two mutants with respect
to the wild-type strain QM6a. Our analysis provides genome-wide insights
into the changes induced by classical mutagenesis in a filamentous
fungus and suggests areas for the generation of enhanced T. reesei

abstract = {Background: Advances in bioinformatic techniques and analyses have
led to the availability of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions.
The size and complexity of such networks often means that their potential
behaviour can only be analysed with constraint-based methods. Whilst
requiring minimal experimental data, such methods are unable to give
insight into cellular substrate concentrations. Instead, the long-term
goal of systems biology is to use kinetic modelling to characterize
fully the mechanics of each enzymatic reaction, and to combine such
knowledge to predict system behaviour.


Results: We describe a method for building a parameterized genome-scale
kinetic model of a metabolic network. Simplified linlog kinetics
are used and the parameters are extracted from a kinetic model repository.
We demonstrate our methodology by applying it to yeast metabolism.
The resultant model has 956 metabolic reactions involving 820 metabolites,
and, whilst approximative, has considerably broader remit than any
existing models of its type. Control analysis is used to identify
key steps within the system.


Conclusions: Our modelling framework may be considered a stepping-stone
toward the long-term goal of a fully- parameterized model of yeast
metabolism. The model is available in SBML format from the BioModels
database (BioModels ID: MODEL1001200000) and at http://www.mcisb.org/resources/genomescale/.},

abstract = {First, the span of absolute judgment and the span of immediate memory impose severe limitations on the amount of information that we are able to receive, process, and remember. By organizing the stimulus input simultaneously into several dimensions and successively into a sequence or chunks, we manage to break (or at least stretch) this informational bottleneck. Second, the process of recoding is a very important one in human psychology and deserves much more explicit attention than it has received. In particular, the kind of linguistic recoding that people do seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes. Recoding procedures are a constant concern to clinicians, social psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists and yet, probably because recoding is less accessible to experimental manipulation than nonsense syllables or T mazes, the traditional experimental psychologist has contributed little or nothing to their analysis. Nevertheless, experimental techniques can be used, methods of recoding can be specified, behavioral indicants can be found. And I anticipate that we will find a very orderly set of relations describing what now seems an uncharted wilderness of individual differences. Third, the concepts and measures provided by the theory of information provide a quantitative way of getting at some of these questions. The theory provides us with a yardstick for calibrating our stimulus materials and for measuring the performance of our subjects. In the interests of communication I have suppressed the technical details of information measurement and have tried to express the ideas in more familiar terms; I hope this paraphrase will not lead you to think they are not useful in research. Informational concepts have already proved valuable in the study of discrimination and of language; they promise a great deal in the study of learning and memory; and it has even been proposed that they can be useful in the study of concept formation. A lot of questions that seemed fruitless twenty or thirty years ago may now be worth another look. In fact, I feel that my story here must stop just as it begins to get really interesting. And finally, what about the magical number seven? What about the seven wonders of the world, the seven seas, the seven deadly sins, the seven daughters of Atlas in the Pleiades, the seven ages of man, the seven levels of hell, the seven primary colors, the seven notes of the musical scale, and the seven days of the week? What about the seven-point rating scale, the seven categories for absolute judgment, the seven objects in the span of attention, and the seven digits in the span of immediate memory? For the present I propose to withhold judgment. Perhaps there is something deep and profound behind all these sevens, something just calling out for us to discover it. But I suspect that it is only a pernicious, Pythagorean coincidence.},

incorporated into KiSAO is desirable for simulation tools. To retrieve
this information programmatically an application programming interface

library to enable querying of the KiSA Ontology. It implements methods
to retrieve information about simulation algorithms stored in KiSAO,
their characteristics and parameters, and methods to query the algorithm
hierarchy and search for similar algorithms providing comparable
results for the same simulation set-up. Using libKiSAO, simulation
tools can make logical inferences based on this knowledge and choose
the most appropriate algorithm to perform a simulation. LibKiSAO
also enables simulation tools to handle a wider range of simulation
descriptions by determining which of the available methods are similar
and can be used instead of the one indicated in the simulation description
if that one is not implemented.CONCLUSIONS:LibKiSAO enables Java

abstract = {Motivation: Describing biological sample variables with ontologies is complex due to the cross-domain nature of experiments. Ontologies provide annotation solutions; however, for cross-domain investigations, multiple ontologies are needed to represent the data. These are subject to rapid change, are often not interoperable and present complexities that are a barrier to biological resource users. Results: We present the Experimental Factor Ontology, designed to meet cross-domain, application focused use cases for gene expression data. We describe our methodology and open source tools used to create the ontology. These include tools for creating ontology mappings, ontology views, detecting ontology changes and using ontologies in interfaces to enhance querying. The application of reference ontologies to data is a key problem, and this work presents guidelines on how community ontologies can be presented in an application ontology in a data-driven way.

abstract = {The concept of elementary (flux) modes provides a rigorous description
of pathways in metabolic networks and proved to be valuable in a
number of applications. However, the computation of elementary modes
is a hard computational task that gave rise to several variants of
algorithms during the last years. This work brings substantial progresses
to this issue. The authors start with a brief review of results obtained
from previous work regarding (a) a unified framework for elementary-mode
computation, (b) network compression and redundancy removal and (c)
the binary approach by which elementary modes are determined as binary
patterns reducing the memory demand drastically without loss of speed.
Then the authors will address herein further issues. First, a new
way to perform the elementarity tests required during the com- putation
of elementary modes which empirically improves significantly the
computation time in large networks is proposed. Second, a method
to compute only those elementary modes where certain reactions are
involved is derived. Relying on this method, a promising approach
for com- puting EMs in a completely distributed manner by decomposing
the full problem in arbitrarity many sub-tasks is presented. The
new methods have been implemented in the freely available software
tools FluxAnalyzer and Metatool and benchmark tests in realistic
networks emphasise the potential of our proposed algorithms.},

@article{Pitkanen09,
abstract = {Background: A central problem in computational metabolic modelling is how to find biochemically plausible pathways between metabolites in a metabolic network. Two general, complementary frameworks have been utilized to find metabolic pathways: constraint-based modelling and graph-theoretical path finding approaches. In constraint-based modelling, one aims to find pathways where metabolites are balanced in a pseudo steady-state. Constraint-based methods, such as elementary flux mode analysis, have typically a high computational cost stemming from a large number of steady-state pathways in a typical metabolic network. On the other hand, graph-theoretical approaches avoid the computational complexity of constraint-based methods by solving a simpler problem of finding shortest paths. However, while scaling well with network size, graph-theoretic methods generally tend to return more false positive pathways than constraint- based methods. Results: In this paper, we introduce a computational method, ReTrace, for finding biochemically relevant, branching metabolic pathways in an atom-level representation of metabolic networks. The method finds compact pathways which transfer a high fraction of atoms from source to target metabolites by considering combinations of linear shortest paths. In contrast to current steady- state pathway analysis methods, our method scales up well and is able to operate on genome-scale models. Further, we show that the pathways produced are biochemically meaningful by an example involving the biosynthesis of inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP). In particular, the method is able to avoid typical problems associated with graph-theoretic approaches such as the need to define side metabolites or pathways not carrying any net carbon flux appearing in results. Finally, we discuss an application involving reconstruction of amino acid pathways of a recently sequenced organism demonstrating how measurement data can be easily incorporated into ReTrace analysis. ReTrace is licensed under GPL and is freely available for academic use at http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/ sysfys/software/retrace/. Conclusion: ReTrace is a useful method in metabolic path finding tasks, combining some of the best aspects in constraint-based and graph-theoretic methods. It finds use in a multitude of tasks ranging from metabolic engineering to metabolic reconstruction of recently sequenced organisms.},

abstract = {The integration of various types of genomic data into predictive models
of biological networks is one of the main challenges currently faced
by computational biology. Constraint-based models in particular play
a key role in the attempt to obtain a quantitative understanding
of cellular metabolism at genome scale. In essence, their goal is
to frame the metabolic capabilities of an organism based on minimal
assumptions that describe the steady states of the underlying reaction
network via suitable stoichiometric constraints, specifically mass
balance and energy balance (i.e. thermodynamic feasibility). The
implementation of these requirements to generate viable configurations
of reaction fluxes and/or to test given flux profiles for thermodynamic
feasibility can however prove to be computationally intensive. We
propose here a fast and scalable stoichiometry-based method to explore
the Gibbs energy landscape of a biochemical network at steady state.
The method is applied to the problem of reconstructing the Gibbs
energy landscape underlying metabolic activity in the human red blood
cell, and to that of identifying and removing thermodynamically infeasible
reaction cycles in the Escherichia coli metabolic network (iAF1260).
In the former case, we produce consistent predictions for chemical
potentials (or log- concentrations) of intracellular metabolites;
in the latter, we identify a restricted set of loops (23 in total)
in the periplasmic and cytoplasmic core as the origin of thermodynamic
infeasibility in a large sample (106) of flux configurations generated
randomly and compatibly with the prior information available on reaction
reversibility.},

@article{Sroka11,
abstract = {Background: Constraint-based approaches facilitate the prediction
of cellular metabolic capabilities, based, in turn on predictions
of the repertoire of enzymes encoded in the genome. Recently, genome
annotations have been used to reconstruct genome scale metabolic
reaction networks for numerous species, including Homo sapiens, which
allow simulations that provide valuable insights into topics, including
predictions of gene essentiality of pathogens, interpretation of
genetic polymorphism in metabolic disease syndromes and suggestions
for novel approaches to microbial metabolic engineering. These constraint-based
simulations are being integrated with the functional genomics portals,
an activity that requires efficient implementation of the constraint-based
simulations in the web-based environment.


Results: Here, we present Acorn, an open source (GNU GPL) grid computing
system for constraint-based simulations of genome scale metabolic
reaction networks within an interactive web environment. The grid-
based architecture allows efficient execution of computationally
intensive, iterative protocols such as Flux Variability Analysis,
which can be readily scaled up as the numbers of models (and users)
increase. The web interface uses AJAX, which facilitates efficient
model browsing and other search functions, and intuitive implementation
of appropriate simulation conditions. Research groups can install
Acorn locally and create user accounts. Users can also import models
in the familiar SBML format and link reaction formulas to major functional
genomics portals of choice. Selected models and simulation results
can be shared between different users and made publically available.
Users can construct pathway map layouts and import them into the
server using a desktop editor integrated within the system. Pathway
maps are then used to visualise numerical results within the web
environment. To illustrate these features we have deployed Acorn
and created a web server allowing constraint based simulations of
the genome scale metabolic reaction networks of E. coli, S. cerevisiae
and M. tuberculosis.


Conclusions: Acorn is a free software package, which can be installed
by research groups to create a web based environment for computer
simulations of genome scale metabolic reaction networks. It facilitates
shared access to models and creation of publicly available constraint
based modelling resources.},

@article{Jouhten09,
abstract = {Background: The filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei is an important
host organism for industrial enzyme production. It is adapted to
nutrient poor environments where it is capable of producing large
amounts of hydrolytic enzymes. In its natural environment T. reesei
is expected to benefit from high energy yield from utilization of
respirative metabolic pathway. However, T. reesei lacks metabolic
pathway reconstructions and the utilization of the respirative pathway
has not been investigated on the level of in vivo fluxes.

Results: The biosynthetic pathways of amino acids in T. reesei supported
by genome-level evidence were reconstructed with computational carbon
path analysis. The pathway reconstructions were a prerequisite for
analysis of in vivo fluxes. The distribution of in vivo fluxes in
both wild type strain and cre1, a key regulator of carbon catabolite
repression, deletion strain were quantitatively studied by performing
13C- labeling on both repressive carbon source glucose and non-repressive
carbon source sorbitol. In addition, the 13C-labeling on sorbitol
was performed both in the presence and absence of sophorose that
induces the expression of cellulase genes. Carbon path analyses and
the 13C-labeling patterns of proteinogenic amino acids indicated
high similarity between biosynthetic pathways of amino acids in T.
reesei and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In contrast to S. cerevisiae,
however, mitochondrial rather than cytosolic biosynthesis of Asp
was observed under all studied conditions. The relative anaplerotic
flux to the TCA cycle was low and thus characteristic to respiratory
metabolism in both strains and independent of the carbon source.
Only minor differences were observed in the flux distributions of
the wild type and cre1 deletion strain. Furthermore, the induction
of the hydrolytic gene expression did not show altered flux distributions
and did not affect the relative amino acid requirements or relative
anabolic and respirative activities of the TCA cycle.

Conclusion: High similarity between the biosynthetic pathways of amino
acids in T. reesei and yeast S. cerevisiae was concluded. In vivo
flux distributions confirmed that T. reesei uses primarily the respirative
pathway also when growing on the repressive carbon source glucose
in contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which substantially diminishes
the respirative pathway flux under glucose repression.},

abstract = {Two divergent modelling methodologies have been adopted to increase our understanding of metabolism and its regulation. Constraint-based modelling highlights the optimal path through a stoichiometric network within certain physicochemical constraints. Such an approach requires minimal biological data to make quantitative inferences about network behaviour; however, constraint-based modelling is unable to give an insight into cellular substrate concentrations. In contrast, kinetic modelling aims to characterize fully the mechanics of each enzymatic reaction. This approach suffers because parameterizing mechanistic models is both costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we outline a method for developing a kinetic model for a metabolic network, based solely on the knowledge of reaction stoichiometries. Fluxes through the system, estimated by flux balance analysis, are allowed to vary dynamically according to linlog kinetics. Elasticities are estimated from stoichiometric considerations. When compared to a popular branched model of yeast glycolysis, we observe an excellent agreement between the real and approximate models, despite the absence of (and indeed the requirement for) experimental data for kinetic constants. Moreover, using this particular methodology affords us analytical forms for steady state determination, stability analyses and studies of dynamical behaviour.},
