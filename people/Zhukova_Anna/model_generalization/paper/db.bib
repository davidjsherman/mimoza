Rhea provides a non-redundant set of chemical transformations for use in a broad spectrum of applications, including metabolic network reconstruction and pathway inference. Rhea includes enzyme-catalyzed reactions (covering the IUBMB Enzyme Nomenclature list), transport reactions and spontaneously occurring reactions. Rhea reactions are described using chemical species from the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest ontology (ChEBI) and are stoichiometrically balanced for mass and charge. They are extensively manually curated with links to source literature and other public resources on metabolism including enzyme and pathway databases. This cross-referencing facilitates the mapping and reconciliation of common reactions and compounds between distinct resources, which is a common first step in the reconstruction of genome scale metabolic networks and models.},

abstract = {The research by the information visualization community (“ Info Viz
”) shows clearly that using a visual representation of data-sets
enables faster analysis by the end users. Several scientific reasons
explain these results. First of all, the visual perception system
is the most powerful of all the human perception systems. In the
human brain, 70\% of the receptors and 40\% of the cortex are used
for the vision process [ 27 , 34 ]. Furthermore, human beings are
better at “recognition” tasks than at “memorization” tasks [ 10 ].
This implies that textual representations are less efficient than
visual metaphors when one wants to analyze huge data-sets. This comes
from the fact that reading is both a memorization task and a recognition
task.},

abstract = {We study the problem of clique-partitioning a graph. We prove a new general upper bound result on the number of clique-partitions. This upper bound is the best possible, given information of just the vertices and the number of edges. Next we show that there exists an optimal partition in which one of the cliques is a maximal clique. Finally we present two new efficient methods to clique-partition a graph. Since the clique-partitioning of a graph is equivalent to the coloring of the complement of the graph, any coloring algorithm can also be used to clique-partition a graph. We present detailed statistics comparing the performance of our algorithms against two of the best known coloring algorithms and against a recently published clique-partitioning algorithm. Both functional and timing comparisons are given and we show that our algorithms compare very favorably on both counts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Yarrowia lipolytica is an oleaginous yeast which has emerged
as an important microorganism for several biotechnological processes,
such as the production of organic acids, lipases and proteases. It
is also considered a good candidate for single-cell oil production.
Although some of its metabolic pathways are well studied, its metabolic
engineering is hindered by the lack of a genome-scale model that
integrates the current knowledge about its metabolism.RESULTS:Combining
in silico tools and expert manual curation, we have produced an accurate
genome-scale metabolic model for Y. lipolytica. Using a scaffold
derived from a functional metabolic model of the well-studied but
phylogenetically distant yeast S. cerevisiae, we mapped conserved
reactions, rewrote gene associations, added species-specific reactions
and inflected specialized copies of scaffold reactions to account
for species-specific expansion of protein families. We used physiological
measures obtained under lab conditions to validate our predictions.CONCLUSIONS:Y.
lipolytica iNL895represents the first well-annotated metabolic model
of an oleaginous yeast, providing a reference for future metabolic
improvement, and a starting point for the metabolic reconstruction
of other species in the Yarrowia clade and other oleaginous yeasts.},

abstract = {The metabolic network is both a network of chemical reactions and a network of enzymes that catalyze reactions. Toward better understanding of this duality in the evolution of the metabolic network, we developed a method to extract conserved sequences of reactions called reaction modules from the analysis of chemical compound structure transformation patterns in all known metabolic pathways stored in the KEGG PATHWAY database. The extracted reaction modules are repeatedly used as if they are building blocks of the metabolic network and contain chemical logic of organic reactions. Furthermore, the reaction modules often correspond to traditional pathway modules defined as sets of enzymes in the KEGG MODULE database and sometimes to operon-like gene clusters in prokaryotic genomes. We identified well-conserved, possibly ancient, reaction modules involving 2-oxocarboxylic acids. The chain extension module that appears as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) reaction sequence in the TCA cycle is now shown to be used in other pathways together with different types of modification modules. We also identified reaction modules and their connection patterns for aromatic ring cleavages in microbial biodegradation pathways, which are most characteristic in terms of both distinct reaction sequences and distinct gene clusters. The modular architecture of biodegradation modules will have a potential for predicting degradation pathways of xenobiotic compounds. The collection of these and many other reaction modules is made available as part of the KEGG database.},

The development of such reconstructions has typically involved a time-consuming, manual process. Recent work has shown that steps undertaken in reconstructing such metabolic networks are amenable to automation. The SuBliMinaL Toolbox (http://www.mcisb.org/subliminal/) facilitates the reconstruction process by providing a number of independent modules to perform common tasks, such as generating draft reconstructions, determining metabolite protonation state, mass and charge balancing reactions, suggesting intracellular compartmentalisation, adding transport reactions and a biomass function, and formatting the reconstruction to be used in third-party analysis packages. The individual modules manipulate reconstructions encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), and can be chained to generate a reconstruction pipeline, or used individually during a manual curation process. This work describes the individual modules themselves, and a study in which the modules were used to develop a metabolic reconstruction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from the existing data resources KEGG and MetaCyc. The automatically generated reconstruction is analysed for blocked reactions, and suggestions for future improvements to the toolbox are discussed.},

These reconstructions represent structured knowledge bases that abstract pertinent information on the biochemical transformations taking place within specific target organisms. The conversion of a reconstruction into a mathematical format facilitates a myriad of computational biological studies, including evaluation of network content, hypothesis testing and generation, analysis of phenotypic characteristics and metabolic engineering. To date, genome-scale metabolic reconstructions for more than 30 organisms have been published and this number is expected to increase rapidly. However, these reconstructions differ in quality and coverage that may minimize their predictive potential and use as knowledge bases. Here we present a comprehensive protocol describing each step necessary to build a high-quality genome-scale metabolic reconstruction, as well as the common trials and tribulations. Therefore, this protocol provides a helpful manual for all stages of the reconstruction process.},

abstract = {In many of the chemical reactions in living cells, enzymes act as catalysts in the conversion of certain compounds (substrates) into other compounds (products). Comparative analyses of the metabolic pathways formed by such reactions give important information on their evolution and on pharmacological targets (Dandekar et al. 1999). Each of the enzymes that constitute a pathway is classified according to the EC (Enzyme Commission) numbering system, which consists of four sets of numbers that categorize the type of the chemical reaction catalyzed. In this study, we consider that reaction similarities can be expressed by the similarities between EC numbers of the respective enzymes. Therefore, in order to find a common pattern among pathways, it is desirable to be able to use the functional hierarchy of EC numbers to express the reaction similarities. In this paper, we propose a multiple alignment algorithm utilizing information content that is extended to symbols having a hierarchical structure. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by applying the method to pathway analyses of sugar, DNA and amino acid metabolisms.},
