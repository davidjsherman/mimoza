\parttitle{Motivation}
Navigation in large metabolic networks is difficult as they include thousands of reactions thought to participate in organism's metabolism. They are intended for computer simulation, but are too detailed for a human. 

\parttitle{Results}
A web-based navigation system Mimoza allows a human expert to explore metabolic models in a semantically zoomable manner: The most general view represents the compartments of the model; the next view shows the generalized versions of reactions and metabolites in each compartment; and the most detailed view represents the initial model with the generalization-based layout (where similar metabolites and reactions are placed next to each other). It allows a human expert in organism's metabolism to grasp the general model structure and analyse it in a top-down manner, going from higher-level general questions to more detailed and specific ones.

\section*{Background}
%The Background section should be written in a way that is accessible to researchers without specialist knowledge in that area and must clearly state - and, if helpful, illustrate - the background to the research and its aims. It should clearly described the relevant context and the specific issue which the software described is intended to address.

Semantic generalization of metabolic models\cite{Zhukova2014} has proven to be a useful theoretical method to aid user understanding of complex networks. It allows to find and group similar metabolites and similar reactions in the network, and bring different models to the same level of abstraction allowing to compare them. 
To explore the opportunities of the method we need to implement it as a practical tool.

Zooming user interface (ZUI)\cite{Bederson1998} paradigm has proven to be a powerful tool for representation data at different scales. It is being adopted for various domains of applications, including cartographic (e.g. Google Maps), general purpose and biological data. The challenge is how to use map-based visualization for semantic generalization.

\subsection*{Metabolic network reconstruction and infrastructure}
There is a conflict between the level of detail of metabolic models needed for computer simulation and the one that can be easily analysed by a human curator: Genome-scale metabolic models include thousands of reactions thought to participate in organism's metabolism, while a human can understand best networks that have hundreds of reaction.

%% Reconstruction
Metabolic network reconstruction process becomes more and more advanced. There exist various tools for semi-automatic model inference, e.g. PathwayTools\cite{Karp2002}, CoReCo\cite{Pitkanen2014}, SuBliMinaL\cite{Swainston2011} (see \cite{Hamilton2014} for a review).

%% Storage
Starting from a model for a similar organism or a collection of pathways and genomic data, they produce a draft model for the target organism. Existing metabolic models can be found in several resources, including Biomodels Database\cite{Li10}, BIGGs\cite{Schellenberger2010}, JWS online\cite{Snoep2003}. KEGG\cite{Kanehisa12} provides an extensive collection of pathways. 

%% Representation
Models are stored and shared using established formats, such as SBML\cite{Hucka2003}, SBGN\cite{Moodie2011}, CEllML\cite{Lloyd2004}. The model representation in this formats can be further enriched with the knowledge from biological databases and ontologies, e.g. ChEBI\cite{deMatos10}, Uniprot\cite{TheUniProtConsortium2013}, by annotating elements of the models (such as metabolites, reactions) with appropriate identifiers. To keep the identifiers representation unique and machine readable such standardisation efforts as Identifiers.org\cite{Juty2012} emerge.

% Why do we need humans?
Although the model inference tools are becoming more and more advanced, curation by a human expert in organism's metabolism remains crucial. Hence means of splitting genome-scale models into smaller units that can be checked and analysed by human experts in the field are needed. An appropriate level of abstraction needs to be found to allow experts to explore and compare whole genome networks. Good model visualisation tools are also required.

\subsection*{Existing visualisation approaches}
% Desktop
There exist various modelling tools for metabolic networks that also support visualisation. Desktop ones include CellDesigner\cite{Funahashi2008}, VANTED\cite{Rohn2012}, Cytoscape\cite{Smoot2011}. They produce reasonably good visualisations of small networks (up to hundreds of reactions), but become cluttered at the genome-scale level, making the visualisation unreadable. For example, the winner of the best SBGN map competition\cite{SBGN}, the ER Stress response\cite{Groenendyk2010} map,  was created manually in CellDesinger.

% Web-based
Web-based tools allowing for model visualisation are also emerging.  JWS online\cite{Snoep2003}, for example, provides a mechanism for model visualisation using a force-directed algorithm. It also encounters the aforementioned issues and thus is not capable of providing a readable representation for large networks.  

MetDraw\cite{Jensen2014} is an online tool for genome-scale metabolic model visualization, that makes use of decomposition of the model into compartments and pathways (if the pathway information in present in the model as a SUBSYSTEM annotation of reactions) and duplication of minor metabolites. The metabolite duplication allows to reduce the clutter but the huge number of reactions in the compartments of some models and missing subsystem annotations, makes the visualisation consume too much space and do not allow a user to grasp the essential structure of the network.

% ZUI
Due to the huge numbers of reactions and of species participating in multiple reactions, either lots of intersections in an automatic visualization of a genome-scale model or over-duplication of various metabolites making the essential parts of the model disconnected and the visualisation too spacious to grasp, is almost unavoidable. An approach different to a simple graph layout algorithm is needed, and ZUI become pertinent.

There are several existing web-based tools providing a zoomable representation of biological data. For instance, NaviCell\cite{Kuperstein2013} is an web environment that allows for exploiting large maps of molecular interactions (mostly signalling), however, without giving a solution to the problem of huge network layout. It does not produce the maps automatically: The user has to create them in CellDesigner, export as an image and manually edit in a graphical designer to produce intermediate views.

Another web-based tool, the Cellular Overview\cite{Latendresse2011} creates interactive diagrams for metabolic maps for organisms in the BioCyc database\cite{Caspi2012}. It is pathway-oriented, and does not contain intermediate levels in a sense that zooming in increases, but does not change existing or show new elements on the map. Another drawback is that it does not show the compartmentalization.

As the examples of NaviCell and the Cellular Overview show, not only zoomable interface but also model decomposition are important for multi-level visualization of huge models. At the general level, the network needs to be decomposed into several meaningful modules (such as compartments, pathways). If after such a decomposition the model remains complicated (e.g. the mitochondrial compartment of the yeast model\cite{Heavner12} that contains N reactions, a further decomposition is required. We address this issue by applying the model generalization method.


\section*{Implementation}
% This should include a description of the overall architecture of the software implementation, along with details of any critical issues and how they were addressed.

\subsection*{Choosing zoom levels}
We address the problem of large-scale metabolic model visualisation by combining meaningful decomposition into modules with automatic multi-level abstraction. Decomposition is performed by splitting the model into compartments and after with the metabolic model generalisation method, so the most appropriate is to adopt 3 levels of semantic zooming:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The most abstract level represents compartmentalization of the model, and focusses on such questions as: Are all the compartments present? Are they well connected by transport reactions?

This level shows the compartments of the model, the transport reactions between them, and other reactions happening inside the cytoplasm.

\item The second level shows the modules inside of each of the compartments. The questions to be addressed at this level include: Are all the essential processes present? Is the structure of each process correct? Is there any organism-specific adaptation of the structure?

We use knowledge-based generalization method to identify the modules inside the compartments. It detects similar metabolites and reactions and clusters them together, representing as generalized metabolites/reactions with the same structure (number of consumed/produced metabolites), and thus allows to keep the essential structure of the model while hiding the details.

\item The most detailed level is intended for computer simulation and represents the inner structure of each of the modules with all the species, reactions and their kinetics, stoichiometry and constraints.

Our method places similar metabolites/reactions (detected on the level 2) next to each other, thus simplifying the analysis of their presence.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Model generalisation}
The metabolic model generalization method\cite{Zhukova2014}, which we recall here, operates on models in \textit{SBML}\cite{Hucka08} format.

% Factoring species into appropriate eq. classes

The method first groups the species present in the network into semantically equivalent classes. The appropriate level of abstraction for those classes is defined by the network itself as the most general one that satisfies two restrictions: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item species that participate in the same reaction cannot be grouped together (to preserve the stoichiometry of the reactions in the network),
 \item species that do not participate in any pair of similar reactions are not grouped together (as there is no evidence of their similarity in the network).
\end{itemize}
 % technical details, e.g. ChEBI
To make species grouping semantically meaningful, an ontology describing hierarchical relationships between biochemical species is used. Each species group is generalized up to the least common ancestor of its elements in the ontology. We use the \textit{ChEBI} ontology, as it is the de facto standard for biochemical species annotation in metabolic networks. %Possible groups for the species are chosen based on hierarchical relationships in the \textit{ChEBI} ontology. 
For instance, \textit{(S)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA}, \textit{(S)-3-hydroxylauroyl-CoA} and \textit{(S)-3-hydroxytetradecanoyl-CoA} have a common ancestor \textit{hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA} in \textit{ChEBI}. If there exist similar reactions operating with them in the network, e.g. \textit{3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase}, and no reaction whose stoichiometry would be broken by such a generalization, then they can be grouped and generalized into \textit{hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA}.

% Once species are factored, we can generalise the reactions
Reactions that share the same generalized reactants and the same generalized products, are considered equivalent and are factored together into a generalized reaction. 

% Ubiquitous species are duplicated (to improve readability)
We do not generalize ubiquitous (frequently occurring) species, e.g. \textit{oxygen}, \textit{hydrogen}, \textit{water}, \textit{ATP}. Grouping species increases the number of reactions they participate in, while these are already shared by many reactions and networks to such an extent that during visualization these species are usually duplicated\cite{Rohn2012} to improve readability.

% Limitations
%As the generalization of species depends on the ChEBI hierarchy, the method tries to find ChEBI terms for the species that lack ChEBI annotations in the model. The search is done by comparing species names to ChEBI terms' names and synonyms. The method does not generalize those species for which no ChEBI mapping can be found. 
% Another characteristic of the method is that, in order to preserve stoichiometry, it cannot factor chains of consecutive similar reactions, i.e. reactions whose reactants could belong to the same equivalence class as products. Our method factors only \textit{parallel} reactions, whose reactants and products belong to distinct equivalence classes.

% Implementation
%The generalization method is implemented as a Python library and is available for download from http://metamogen.gforge.inria.fr. The generalized network is produced in SBML format with groups annotations\cite{Hucka2012}.

\subsection*{Layers Layout}
While layout of large graphs is widely studied\cite{Unwin2006}, the correspondence between the layouts of different zoom levels remains a hard task. To compute the layout for different zoom levels we use Tulip graph visualization software\cite{Auber04} and two different approaches.
\subsubsection*{Generalised model layout}
% General idea
In order to layout the sub-models corresponding to each of the organelles after the generalisation, we use a combination of standard layout algorithms provided by Tulip. We divide the organelle graph into connected components and then apply an appropriate layout algorithm on each of them. The results are combined together using the 'Connected Component Packing' algorithm, which places the components close to each other while removing the overlaps between them.

% Laying out a connected component
Depending on the nature of the connected component subgraph, we choose one of the following layout algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Hierarchical Layout} for the components that contain no cycles,
\item \emph{Circular Layout} for the components with less than 100 nodes and less than 3 cycles,
\item \emph{Force-Directed Layout} for all the other components.
\end{itemize}

% Ubiquitous species hadling
To avoid cluttering we duplicate all the ubiquitous species before applying the layout algorithms, so that there is a copy of an ubiquitous species for each reaction it participates in. We then extract a subgraph, containing all but the ubiquitous species, apply the combined layout on it, and then place the ubiquitous species next to the reactions they participate in.

\subsubsection*{Generalization-based full model layout}
The layout for the full model is based on the corresponding generalised model's layout. To allow for zooming into the generalized model, we keep the same coordinates as in the generalized model for the ubiquitous species, and species and reactions that are not generalised, and place similar species/reactions next to each other inside the space used by the corresponding generalized species/reactions in the generalized model. This also allows for grasping similar processed at the same time. 
 
\subsection*{ZUI}

The zoomable interactive representation is achieved using Leaflet\cite{Agafonkin}, a JavaScript library for interactive maps. 

We export elements of the model (compartments, species and reactions) in GeoJSON format\cite{Butler} that allows to store their coordinates and metadata (e.g. ChEBI annotations for species). Figure~\ref{geojson} shows an example of a species representation in GeoJSON format. 

The GeoJSON objects are then added as layers to the map and rendered by Leaflet into clickable elements at corresponding zoom levels. Species are represented as circles, and reactions as squares, following the SBGN standard\cite{Moodie2011}.  When a user clicks on a map element a pop-up appears (see Figure~\ref{pop_up}) showing its name, identifier and additional information, e.g. gene associations, and formulas for reactions.
 

\subsection*{Embedding}
After the visualization with Mimoza is done, we provide a link for embedding it on the users web-page.

\subsection*{Download and distribution}

One can use Mimoza in three different ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item As a standalone application.
All Mimoza code is open-source and can be downloaded from the project web-page\cite{Zhukovaa} and installed on a local server.
\item On the Mimoza web-server.
Mimoza web-server\cite{Zhukovaa} allows to try the visualization for smaller models, with a possibility to download the result as a COMBINE archive\cite{LeNovere}, including the SBML file with the generalized model, GeoJSON files with the model elements coordinates, and the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, needed to view the visualisation in a browser.
\item As a Galaxy\cite{Blankenberg2010} project tool.
The Galaxy wrapper for Mimoza is available for download from the project web-page.
\end{enumerate}

 
\subsection*{Pipeline}
The overall Mimoza pipeline  contains of 5 steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The user submits a model in SBML format via a web-form.
\item If the model contains no group annotations, it is generalised using model generalization method, and the resulting SBML file is made available to the user.
\item The SBML file with the groups annotation is converted into a Tulip graph: metabolite nodes are connected by edges to the nodes of the reactions they participate in. The generalised metabolites and reactions form quotient nodes. The Tulip graph is split into sub-graphs corresponding to different compartments, and layout algorithms are applied to them.
\item The organelle sub-graphs are exported in GeoJSON format and rendered by the Leaflet library into an interactive map that is represented to the user.
\item The result can either be browsed on the Mimoza web page directly, or downloaded as a COMBINE archive and embedded into a different web-cite.

%The Results and Discussion may be combined into a single section or presented separately. They may also be broken into subsections with short, informative headings. In any case what should be described is the functionality of the software together with data on how its performance and functionality compare with and improve on functionally similar existing software. There should then be a discussion of the intended use of the software, and the benefits that are envisioned together, if possible, with an outline for the planned future development of new features.

Future work: use more sophisticated layout of the generalized level (e.g. anchored).
Add opportunity to change layout / annotations, etc.

Combine several models as an input.

\section*{Conclusions}
%This should state clearly the main conclusions of the article and give a clear explanation of the importance and relevance of the software.

Mimoza is an amazing tool that everyone was waiting for and can finally use and become happy!
