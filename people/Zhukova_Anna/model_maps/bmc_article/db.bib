abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systems biology projects and omics technologies have led to a growing number of biochemical pathway models and reconstructions. However, the majority of these models are still created de novo, based on literature mining and the manual processing of pathway data. RESULTS: To increase the efficiency of model creation, the Path2Models project has automatically generated mathematical models from pathway representations using a suite of freely available software. Data sources include KEGG, BioCarta, MetaCyc and SABIO-RK. Depending on the source data, three types of models are provided: kinetic, logical and constraint-based. Models from over 2 600 organisms are encoded consistently in SBML, and are made freely available through BioModels Database at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/path2models. Each model contains the list of participants, their interactions, the relevant mathematical constructs, and initial parameter values. Most models are also available as easy-to-understand graphical SBGN maps. CONCLUSIONS: To date, the project has resulted in more than 140 000 freely available models. Such a resource can tremendously accelerate the development of mathematical models by providing initial starting models for simulation and analysis, which can be subsequently curated and further parameterized.},

@article{Coskun2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are multiple representation formats for Systems Biology computational models, and the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is one of the most widely used. SBML is used to capture, store, and distribute computational models by Systems Biology data sources (e.g., the BioModels Database) and researchers. Therefore, there is a need for all-in-one web-based solutions that support advance SBML functionalities such as uploading, editing, composing, visualizing, simulating, querying, and browsing computational models. RESULTS: We present the design and implementation of the Model Composition Tool (Interface) within the PathCase-SB (PathCase Systems Biology) web portal. The tool helps users compose systems biology models to facilitate the complex process of merging systems biology models. We also present three tools that support the model composition tool, namely, (1) Model Simulation Interface that generates a visual plot of the simulation according to user's input, (2) iModel Tool as a platform for users to upload their own models to compose, and (3) SimCom Tool that provides a side by side comparison of models being composed in the same pathway. Finally, we provide a web site that hosts BioModels Database models and a separate web site that hosts SBML Test Suite models. CONCLUSIONS: Model composition tool (and the other three tools) can be used with little or no knowledge of the SBML document structure. For this reason, students or anyone who wants to learn about systems biology will benefit from the described functionalities. SBML Test Suite models will be a nice starting point for beginners. And, for more advanced purposes, users will able to access and employ models of the BioModels Database as well.},

@article{Umeton2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The information coming from biomedical ontologies and computational pathway models is expanding continuously: research communities keep this process up and their advances are generally shared by means of dedicated resources published on the web. In fact, such models are shared to provide the characterization of molecular processes, while biomedical ontologies detail a semantic context to the majority of those pathways. Recent advances in both fields pave the way for a scalable information integration based on aggregate knowledge repositories, but the lack of overall standard formats impedes this progress. Indeed, having different objectives and different abstraction levels, most of these resources "speak" different languages. Semantic web technologies are here explored as a means to address some of these problems. METHODS: Employing an extensible collection of interpreters, we developed OREMP (Ontology Reasoning Engine for Molecular Pathways), a system that abstracts the information from different resources and combines them together into a coherent ontology. Continuing this effort we present OREMPdb; once different pathways are fed into OREMP, species are linked to the external ontologies referred and to reactions in which they participate. Exploiting these links, the system builds species-sets, which encapsulate species that operate together. Composing all of the reactions together, the system computes all of the reaction paths from-and-to all of the species-sets. RESULTS: OREMP has been applied to the curated branch of BioModels (2011/04/15 release) which overall contains 326 models, 9244 reactions, and 5636 species. OREMPdb is the semantic dictionary created as a result, which is made of 7360 species-sets. For each one of these sets, OREMPdb links the original pathway and the link to the original paper where this information first appeared.},

@article{Krause2010,
abstract = {SUMMARY: Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is the leading exchange format for mathematical models in Systems Biology. Semantic annotations link model elements with external knowledge via unique database identifiers and ontology terms, enabling software to check and process models by their biochemical meaning. Such information is essential for model merging, one of the key steps towards the construction of large kinetic models. SemanticSBML is a tool that helps users to check and edit MIRIAM annotations and SBO terms in SBML models. Using a large collection of biochemical names and database identifiers, it supports modellers in finding the right annotations and in merging existing models. Initially, an element matching is derived from the MIRIAM annotations and conflicting element attributes are categorized and highlighted. Conflicts can then be resolved automatically or manually, allowing the user to control the merging process in detail. AVAILABILITY: SemanticSBML comes as a free software written in Python and released under the GPL 3. A Debian package, a source package for other Linux distributions, a Windows installer and an online version of semanticSBML with limited functionality are available at http://www.semanticsbml.org. A preinstalled version can be found on the Linux live DVD SB.OS, available at http://www.sbos.eu. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{Schulz2006,
abstract = {The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is an XML-based format for representing mathematical models of biochemical reaction networks, and it is likely to become a main standard in the systems biology community. As published mathematical models in cell biology are growing in number and size, modular modelling approaches will gain additional importance. The main issue to be addressed in computer-assisted model combination is the specification and handling of model semantics. The software SBMLmerge assists the user in combining models of biological subsystems to larger biochemical networks. First, the program helps the user in annotating all model elements with unique identifiers pointing to databases such as KEGG or Gene Ontology. Second, during merging, SBMLmerge detects and resolves various syntactic and semantic problems. Typical problems are conflicting variable names, elements which appear in more than one input model, and mathematical problems arising from the combination of equations. If the input models make contradicting statements about a biochemical quantity, the user is asked to choose between them. In the end the merging process results in a new, valid SBML model.},

@article{Klamt07,
abstract = {Background: Mathematical modelling of cellular networks is an integral
part of Systems Biology and requires appropriate software tools.
An important class of methods in Systems Biology deals with structural
or topological (parameter-free) analysis of cellular networks. So
far, software tools providing such methods for both mass-flow (metabolic)
as well as signal-flow (signalling and regulatory) networks are lacking.


Results: Herein we introduce CellNetAnalyzer, a toolbox for MATLAB
facilitating, in an interactive and visual manner, a comprehensive
structural analysis of metabolic, signalling and regulatory networks.
The particular strengths of CellNetAnalyzer are methods for functional
network analysis, i.e. for characterising functional states, for
detecting functional dependencies, for identifying intervention strategies,
or for giving qualitative predictions on the effects of perturbations.
CellNetAnalyzer extends its predecessor FluxAnalyzer (originally
developed for metabolic network and pathway analysis) by a new modelling
framework for examining signal-flow networks. Two of the novel methods
implemented in CellNetAnalyzer are discussed in more detail regarding
algorithmic issues and applications: the computation and analysis
(i) of shortest positive and shortest negative paths and circuits
in interaction graphs and (ii) of minimal intervention sets in logical
networks.


Conclusion: CellNetAnalyzer provides a single suite to perform structural
and qualitative analysis of both mass-flow- and signal-flow-based
cellular networks in a user-friendly environment. It provides a large
toolbox with various, partially unique, functions and algorithms
for functional network analysis. CellNetAnalyzer is freely available
for academic use.},

An update has now been built, named iJO1366, which accounts for 1366 genes, 2251 metabolic reactions, and 1136 unique metabolites. iJO1366 was (1) updated in part using a new experimental screen of 1075 gene knockout strains, illuminating cases where alternative pathways and isozymes are yet to be discovered, (2) compared with its predecessor and to experimental data sets to confirm that it continues to make accurate phenotypic predictions of growth on different substrates and for gene knockout strains, and (3) mapped to the genomes of all available sequenced E. coli strains, including pathogens, leading to the identification of hundreds of unannotated genes in these organisms. Like its predecessors, the iJO1366 reconstruction is expected to be widely deployed for studying the systems biology of E. coli and for metabolic engineering applications.},

abstract = {Multiple models of human metabolism have been reconstructed, but each represents only a subset of our knowledge. Here we describe Recon 2, a community-driven, consensus 'metabolic reconstruction', which is the most comprehensive representation of human metabolism that is applicable to computational modeling. Compared with its predecessors, the reconstruction has improved topological and functional features, including ∼2× more reactions and ∼1.7× more unique metabolites. Using Recon 2 we predicted changes in metabolite biomarkers for 49 inborn errors of metabolism with 77\% accuracy when compared to experimental data. Mapping metabolomic data and drug information onto Recon 2 demonstrates its potential for integrating and analyzing diverse data types. Using protein expression data, we automatically generated a compendium of 65 cell type-specific models, providing a basis for manual curation or investigation of cell-specific metabolic properties.

@article{Jianu2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biologists often need to assess whether unfamiliar datasets warrant the time investment required for more detailed exploration. Basing such assessments on brief descriptions provided by data publishers is unwieldy for large datasets that contain insights dependent on specific scientific questions. Alternatively, using complex software systems for a preliminary analysis may be deemed as too time consuming in itself, especially for unfamiliar data types and formats. This may lead to wasted analysis time and discarding of potentially useful data.

RESULTS: We present an exploration of design opportunities that the Google Maps interface offers to biomedical data visualization. In particular, we focus on synergies between visualization techniques and Google Maps that facilitate the development of biological visualizations which have both low-overhead and sufficient expressivity to support the exploration of data at multiple scales. The methods we explore rely on displaying pre-rendered visualizations of biological data in browsers, with sparse yet powerful interactions, by using the Google Maps API. We structure our discussion around five visualizations: a gene co-regulation visualization, a heatmap viewer, a genome browser, a protein interaction network, and a planar visualization of white matter in the brain. Feedback from collaborative work with domain experts suggests that our Google Maps visualizations offer multiple, scale-dependent perspectives and can be particularly helpful for unfamiliar datasets due to their accessibility. We also find that users, particularly those less experienced with computer use, are attracted by the familiarity of the Google Maps API. Our five implementations introduce design elements that can benefit visualization developers.

CONCLUSIONS: We describe a low-overhead approach that lets biologists access readily analyzed views of unfamiliar scientific datasets. We rely on pre-computed visualizations prepared by data experts, accompanied by sparse and intuitive interactions, and distributed via the familiar Google Maps framework. Our contributions are an evaluation demonstrating the validity and opportunities of this approach, a set of design guidelines benefiting those wanting to create such visualizations, and five concrete example visualizations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular biology data exist on diverse scales, from the level of molecules to -omics. At the same time, the data at each scale can be categorised into multiple layers, such as the genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and biochemical pathways. Due to the highly multi-layer and multi-dimensional nature of biological information, software interfaces for database browsing should provide an intuitive interface that allows for rapid migration across different views and scales. The Zoomable User Interface (ZUI) and tabbed browsing have proven successful for this purpose in other areas, especially to navigate the vast information in the World Wide Web.

RESULTS: This paper presents Genome Projector, a Web-based gateway for genomics information with a zoomable user interface using Google Maps API, equipped with four seamlessly accessible and searchable views: a circular genome map, a traditional genome map, a biochemical pathways map, and a DNA walk map. The Web application for 320 bacterial genomes is available at http://www.g-language.org/GenomeProjector/. All data and software including the source code, documentations, and development API are freely available under the GNU General Public License. Zoomable maps can be easily created from any image file using the development API, and an online data mapping service for Genome Projector is also available at our Web site.

abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic model reconstruction is a complicated process beginning with (semi-)automatic inference of the reactions participating in the organism's metabolism, followed by many iterations of network analysis and improvement. Despite advances in automatic model inference and analysis tools, reconstruction may still miss some reactions or add erroneous ones. Consequently, a human expert's analysis of the model will continue to play an important role in all the iterations of the reconstruction process. This analysis is hampered by the size of the genome-scale models (typically thousands of reactions), which makes it hard for a human to understand them. To aid human experts in curating and analyzing metabolic models, we have developed a method for knowledge-based generalization that provides a higher-level view of a metabolic model, masking its inessential details while presenting its essential structure. The method groups biochemical species in the model into semantically equivalent classes based on the ChEBI ontology, identifies reactions that become equivalent with respect to the generalized species, and factors those reactions into generalized reactions. Generalization allows curators to quickly identify divergences from the expected structure of the model, such as alternative paths or missing reactions, that are the priority targets for further curation. We have applied our method to genome-scale yeast metabolic models and shown that it improves understanding by helping to identify both specificities and potential errors.},

abstract = {System-level analyses of microbial metabolism are facilitated by genome-scale reconstructions of microbial biochemical networks. A reconstruction provides a structured representation of the biochemical transformations occurring within an organism, as well as the genes necessary to carry out these transformations, as determined by the annotated genome sequence and experimental data. Network reconstructions also serve as platforms for constraint-based computational techniques, which facilitate biological studies in a variety of applications, including evaluation of network properties, metabolic engineering and drug discovery. Bottom-up metabolic network reconstructions have been developed for dozens of organisms, but until recently, the pace of reconstruction has failed to keep up with advances in genome sequencing. To address this problem, a number of software platforms have been developed to automate parts of the reconstruction process, thereby alleviating much of the manual effort previously required. Here, we review four such platforms in the context of established guidelines for network reconstruction. While many steps of the reconstruction process have been successfully automated, some manual evaluation of the results is still required to ensure a high-quality reconstruction. Widespread adoption of these platforms by the scientific community is underway and will be further enabled by exchangeable formats across platforms.},

abstract = {Genomic data allow the large-scale manual or semi-automated assembly of metabolic network reconstructions, which provide highly curated organism-specific knowledge bases. Although several genome-scale network reconstructions describe Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism, they differ in scope and content, and use different terminologies to describe the same chemical entities. This makes comparisons between them difficult and underscores the desirability of a consolidated metabolic network that collects and formalizes the 'community knowledge' of yeast metabolism. We describe how we have produced a consensus metabolic network reconstruction for S. cerevisiae. In drafting it, we placed special emphasis on referencing molecules to persistent databases or using database-independent forms, such as SMILES or InChI strings, as this permits their chemical structure to be represented unambiguously and in a manner that permits automated reasoning. The reconstruction is readily available via a publicly accessible database and in the Systems Biology Markup Language (http://www.comp-sys-bio.org/yeastnet). It can be maintained as a resource that serves as a common denominator for studying the systems biology of yeast. Similar strategies should benefit communities studying genome-scale metabolic networks of other organisms.},

A central challenge is to move beyond the display of a static network to visualizations of networks as a function of time, space and cell state, which capture the adaptability of the cell. We consider approaches for representing the role of protein complexes in the cell cycle, displaying modules of metabolism in a hierarchical format, integrating experimental interaction data with structured vocabularies such as Gene Ontology categories and representing conserved interactions among orthologous groups of genes.},

Scientists can no longer interact directly with the huge amount of available data. However, future breakthroughs in biology depend on this interaction. We propose a new metaphor for biological data visualization and browsing that allows navigation in very large databases in an intuitive way. The concepts underlying our approach are based on navigation and visualization with zooming, semantic zooming and portals; and on data transformation via magic lenses. We think that these new visualization and navigation techniques should be applied globally to a federation of biological databases. RESULTS: We have implemented a generic tool, called Zomit, that provides an application programming interface for developing servers for such navigation and visualization, and a generic architecture-independent client (Javatrade mark applet) that queries such servers. As an illustration of the capabilities of our approach, we have developed ZoomMap, a prototype browser for the HuGeMap human genome map database.

abstract = {The generation and use of metabolic network reconstructions has increased over recent years. The development of such reconstructions has typically involved a time-consuming, manual process. Recent work has shown that steps undertaken in reconstructing such metabolic networks are amenable to automation. The SuBliMinaL Toolbox (http://www.mcisb.org/subliminal/) facilitates the reconstruction process by providing a number of independent modules to perform common tasks, such as generating draft reconstructions, determining metabolite protonation state, mass and charge balancing reactions, suggesting intracellular compartmentalisation, adding transport reactions and a biomass function, and formatting the reconstruction to be used in third-party analysis packages. The individual modules manipulate reconstructions encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), and can be chained to generate a reconstruction pipeline, or used individually during a manual curation process. This work describes the individual modules themselves, and a study in which the modules were used to develop a metabolic reconstruction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from the existing data resources KEGG and MetaCyc. The automatically generated reconstruction is analysed for blocked reactions, and suggestions for future improvements to the toolbox are discussed.},

abstract = {Network reconstructions are a common denominator in systems biology. Bottom-up metabolic network reconstructions have been developed over the last 10 years. These reconstructions represent structured knowledge bases that abstract pertinent information on the biochemical transformations taking place within specific target organisms. The conversion of a reconstruction into a mathematical format facilitates a myriad of computational biological studies, including evaluation of network content, hypothesis testing and generation, analysis of phenotypic characteristics and metabolic engineering. To date, genome-scale metabolic reconstructions for more than 30 organisms have been published and this number is expected to increase rapidly. However, these reconstructions differ in quality and coverage that may minimize their predictive potential and use as knowledge bases. Here we present a comprehensive protocol describing each step necessary to build a high-quality genome-scale metabolic reconstruction, as well as the common trials and tribulations. Therefore, this protocol provides a helpful manual for all stages of the reconstruction process.},

@article{Tohsato2000,
abstract = {In many of the chemical reactions in living cells, enzymes act as catalysts in the conversion of certain compounds (substrates) into other compounds (products). Comparative analyses of the metabolic pathways formed by such reactions give important information on their evolution and on pharmacological targets (Dandekar et al. 1999). Each of the enzymes that constitute a pathway is classified according to the EC (Enzyme Commission) numbering system, which consists of four sets of numbers that categorize the type of the chemical reaction catalyzed. In this study, we consider that reaction similarities can be expressed by the similarities between EC numbers of the respective enzymes. Therefore, in order to find a common pattern among pathways, it is desirable to be able to use the functional hierarchy of EC numbers to express the reaction similarities. In this paper, we propose a multiple alignment algorithm utilizing information content that is extended to symbols having a hierarchical structure. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by applying the method to pathway analyses of sugar, DNA and amino acid metabolisms.},

Next we show that there exists an optimal partition in which one of the cliques is a maximal clique. Finally we present two new efficient methods to clique-partition a graph. Since the clique-partitioning of a graph is equivalent to the coloring of the complement of the graph, any coloring algorithm can also be used to clique-partition a graph. We present detailed statistics comparing the performance of our algorithms against two of the best known coloring algorithms and against a recently published clique-partitioning algorithm. Both functional and timing comparisons are given and we show that our algorithms compare very favorably on both counts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Molecular biology knowledge can be formalized and systematically represented in a computer-readable form as a comprehensive map of molecular interactions. There exist an increasing number of maps of molecular interactions containing detailed and step-wise description of various cell mechanisms. It is difficult to explore these large maps, to organize discussion of their content and to maintain them. Several efforts were recently made to combine these capabilities together in one environment, and NaviCell is one of them.RESULTS:NaviCell is a web-based environment for exploiting large maps of molecular interactions, created in CellDesigner, allowing their easy exploration, curation and maintenance. It is characterized by a combination of three essential features: (1) efficient map browsing based on Google Maps; (2) semantic zooming for viewing different levels of details or of abstraction of the map and (3) integrated web-based blog for collecting community feedback. NaviCell can be easily used by experts in the field of molecular biology for studying molecular entities of interest in the context of signaling pathways and crosstalk between pathways within a global signaling network. NaviCell allows both exploration of detailed molecular mechanisms represented on the map and a more abstract view of the map up to a top-level modular representation. NaviCell greatly facilitates curation, maintenance and updating the comprehensive maps of molecular interactions in an interactive and user-friendly fashion due to an imbedded blogging system.CONCLUSIONS:NaviCell provides user-friendly exploration of large-scale maps of molecular interactions, thanks to Google Maps and WordPress interfaces, with which many users are already familiar. Semantic zooming which is used for navigating geographical maps is adopted for molecular maps in NaviCell, making any level of visualization readable. In addition, NaviCell provides a framework for community-based curation of maps.},

Description: We present a Web-based metabolic-map diagram, which can be interactively explored by the user, called the Cellular Overview. The main characteristic of this application is the zooming user interface enabling the user to focus on appropriate granularities of the network at will. Various searching commands are available to visually highlight sets of reactions, pathways, enzymes, metabolites, and so on. Expression data from single or multiple experiments can be overlaid on the diagram, which we call the Omics Viewer capability. The application provides Web services to highlight the diagram and to invoke the Omics Viewer. This application is entirely written in JavaScript for the client browsers and connect to a Pathway Tools Web server to retrieve data and diagrams. It uses the OpenLayers library to display tiled diagrams. Conclusions: This new online tool is capable of displaying large and complex metabolic-map diagrams in a very interactive manner.

The library (available in C++ and Java) makes it easy for developers to add SBGN support to their tools, whereas the file format facilitates the exchange of maps between compatible software applications. The library also supports validation of maps, which simplifies the task of ensuring compliance with the detailed SBGN specifications. With this effort we hope to increase the adoption of SBGN in bioinformatics tools, ultimately enabling more researchers to visualize biological knowledge in a precise and unambiguous manner.

The model was validated in a bibliomic study of in total 440 references, and it comprises 1471 unique biochemical reactions and 1006 ORFs. It was then used to study the roles of ATP and NADPH in the biosynthesis of penicillin, and to identify potential metabolic engineering targets for maximization of penicillin production.},

@article{Wrzodek2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The KEGG PATHWAY database provides a plethora of pathways for a diversity of organisms. All pathway components are directly linked to other KEGG databases, such as KEGG COMPOUND or KEGG REACTION. Therefore, the pathways can be extended with an enormous amount of information and provide a foundation for initial structural modeling approaches. As a drawback, KGML-formatted KEGG pathways are primarily designed for visualization purposes and often omit important details for the sake of a clear arrangement of its entries. Thus, a direct conversion into systems biology models would produce incomplete and erroneous models.

RESULTS: Here, we present a precise method for processing and converting KEGG pathways into initial metabolic and signaling models encoded in the standardized community pathway formats SBML (Levels 2 and 3) and BioPAX (Levels 2 and 3). This method involves correcting invalid or incomplete KGML content, creating complete and valid stoichiometric reactions, translating relations to signaling models and augmenting the pathway content with various information, such as cross-references to Entrez Gene, OMIM, UniProt ChEBI, and many more.Finally, we compare several existing conversion tools for KEGG pathways and show that the conversion from KEGG to BioPAX does not involve a loss of information, whilst lossless translations to SBML can only be performed using SBML Level 3, including its recently proposed qualitative models and groups extension packages.

CONCLUSIONS: Building correct BioPAX and SBML signaling models from the KEGG database is a unique characteristic of the proposed method. Further, there is no other approach that is able to appropriately construct metabolic models from KEGG pathways, including correct reactions with stoichiometry. The resulting initial models, which contain valid and comprehensive SBML or BioPAX code and a multitude of cross-references, lay the foundation to facilitate further modeling steps.},

abstract = {Advances in biotechnology and experimental techniques have lead to the elucidation of vast amounts of biological data. Mathematical models provide a method of analysing this data; however, there are two issues that need to be addressed: (1) the need for standards for defining cell models so they can, for example, be exchanged across the World Wide Web, and also read into simulation software in a consistent format and (2) eliminating the errors which arise with the current method of model publication. CellML has evolved to meet these needs of the modelling community. CellML is a free, open-source, eXtensible markup language based standard for defining mathematical models of cellular function. In this paper we summarise the structure of CellML, its current applications (including biological pathway and electrophysiological models), and its future development--in particular, the development of toolsets and the integration of ontologies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Yarrowia lipolytica is an oleaginous yeast which has emerged
as an important microorganism for several biotechnological processes,
such as the production of organic acids, lipases and proteases. It
is also considered a good candidate for single-cell oil production.
Although some of its metabolic pathways are well studied, its metabolic
engineering is hindered by the lack of a genome-scale model that
integrates the current knowledge about its metabolism.RESULTS:Combining
in silico tools and expert manual curation, we have produced an accurate
genome-scale metabolic model for Y. lipolytica. Using a scaffold
derived from a functional metabolic model of the well-studied but
phylogenetically distant yeast S. cerevisiae, we mapped conserved
reactions, rewrote gene associations, added species-specific reactions
and inflected specialized copies of scaffold reactions to account
for species-specific expansion of protein families. We used physiological
measures obtained under lab conditions to validate our predictions.CONCLUSIONS:Y.
lipolytica iNL895represents the first well-annotated metabolic model
of an oleaginous yeast, providing a reference for future metabolic
improvement, and a starting point for the metabolic reconstruction
of other species in the Yarrowia clade and other oleaginous yeasts.},

Ironically, despite having one of the highest ratios of graphical to textual information, biology still lacks standard graphical notations. The recent deluge of biological knowledge makes addressing this deficit a pressing concern. Toward this goal, we present the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN), a visual language developed by a community of biochemists, modelers and computer scientists. SBGN consists of three complementary languages: process diagram, entity relationship diagram and activity flow diagram. Together they enable scientists to represent networks of biochemical interactions in a standard, unambiguous way. We believe that SBGN will foster efficient and accurate representation, visualization, storage, exchange and reuse of information on all kinds of biological knowledge, from gene regulation, to metabolism, to cellular signaling.},

abstract = {The metabolic network is both a network of chemical reactions and a network of enzymes that catalyze reactions. Toward better understanding of this duality in the evolution of the metabolic network, we developed a method to extract conserved sequences of reactions called reaction modules from the analysis of chemical compound structure transformation patterns in all known metabolic pathways stored in the KEGG PATHWAY database. The extracted reaction modules are repeatedly used as if they are building blocks of the metabolic network and contain chemical logic of organic reactions. Furthermore, the reaction modules often correspond to traditional pathway modules defined as sets of enzymes in the KEGG MODULE database and sometimes to operon-like gene clusters in prokaryotic genomes. We identified well-conserved, possibly ancient, reaction modules involving 2-oxocarboxylic acids. The chain extension module that appears as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) reaction sequence in the TCA cycle is now shown to be used in other pathways together with different types of modification modules. We also identified reaction modules and their connection patterns for aromatic ring cleavages in microbial biodegradation pathways, which are most characteristic in terms of both distinct reaction sequences and distinct gene clusters. The modular architecture of biodegradation modules will have a potential for predicting degradation pathways of xenobiotic compounds. The collection of these and many other reaction modules is made available as part of the KEGG database.},

Additionally, eight user tests were carried out by ordinary users in a usability laboratory. In all, 403 usability problems were identified during the trial and were grouped according to their severity. A qualitative description is given of these usability problems, many of which were related to search operations that the users performed at the Web mapping sites.

abstract = {We introduce a novel computational approach, CoReCo, for comparative metabolic reconstruction and provide genome-scale metabolic network models for 49 important fungal species. Leveraging on the exponential growth in sequenced genome availability, our method reconstructs genome-scale gapless metabolic networks simultaneously for a large number of species by integrating sequence data in a probabilistic framework. High reconstruction accuracy is demonstrated by comparisons to the well-curated Saccharomyces cerevisiae consensus model and large-scale knock-out experiments. Our comparative approach is particularly useful in scenarios where the quality of available sequence data is lacking, and when reconstructing evolutionary distant species. Moreover, the reconstructed networks are fully carbon mapped, allowing their use in 13C flux analysis. We demonstrate the functionality and usability of the reconstructed fungal models with computational steady-state biomass production experiment, as these fungi include some of the most important production organisms in industrial biotechnology. In contrast to many existing reconstruction techniques, only minimal manual effort is required before the reconstructed models are usable in flux balance experiments. CoReCo is available at http://esaskar.github.io/CoReCo/.},

Such multiple linked views (MLVs) enable the user to quickly view a scenario, compare it with previous realizations, examine properties such as dependencies and sizes, and put this view to one side and try out another scenario. There are many good principles that can be learned from examining the way other systems achieve this MLV exploration. In geovisualization, the explorer often generates many spatial or abstract representations. With such exploratory environments, the user is able (even encouraged) to take a hands-on approach to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying information and can also change various parameter values of a visualization system that in turn alters the appearance of the visual result. In addition, the user may generate additional windows that contain the visual result of the new parameters so they can compare different ideas side-by-side.

BiGG integrates several published genome-scale metabolic networks into one resource with standard nomenclature which allows components to be compared across different organisms. BiGG can be used to browse model content, visualize metabolic pathway maps, and export SBML files of the models for further analysis by external software packages. Users may follow links from BiGG to several external databases to obtain additional information on genes, proteins, reactions, metabolites and citations of interest.

Several scientific reasons explain these results. First of all, the visual perception system is the most powerful of all the human perception systems. In the human brain, 70\% of the receptors and 40\% of the cortex are used for the vision process [ 27 , 34 ]. Furthermore, human beings are better at “recognition” tasks than at “memorization” tasks [ 10 ]. This implies that textual representations are less efficient than visual metaphors when one wants to analyze huge data-sets. This comes from the fact that reading is both a memorization task and a recognition task.},

abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic models are built using information from an organism's annotated genome and, correspondingly, information on reactions catalyzed by the set of metabolic enzymes encoded by the genome. These models have been successfully applied to guide metabolic engineering to increase production of metabolites of industrial interest. Congruity between simulated and experimental metabolic behavior is influenced by the accuracy of the representation of the metabolic network in the model. In the interest of applying the consensus model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism for increased productivity of triglycerides, we manually evaluated the representation of fatty acid, glycerophospholipid, and glycerolipid metabolism in the consensus model (Yeast v6.0). These areas of metabolism were chosen due to their tightly interconnected nature to triglyceride synthesis. Manual curation was facilitated by custom MATLAB functions that return information contained in the model for reactions associated with genes and metabolites within the stated areas of metabolism. Through manual curation, we have identified inconsistencies between information contained in the model and literature knowledge. These inconsistencies include incorrect gene-reaction associations, improper definition of substrates/products in reactions, inappropriate assignments of reaction directionality, nonfunctional $\beta$-oxidation pathways, and missing reactions relevant to the synthesis and degradation of triglycerides. Suggestions to amend these inconsistencies in the Yeast v6.0 model can be implemented through a MATLAB script provided in the Supplementary Materials, Supplementary Data S1(Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/ind).},

abstract = {Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) is a freely available
dictionary of molecular entities focused on ‚\"{A}\`{o}small‚\"{A}\^{o} chemical
compounds. The molecular entities in question are either natural
products or synthetic products used to intervene in the processes
of living organisms. Genome-encoded macromolecules (nucleic acids,
proteins and peptides derived from proteins by cleavage) are not
as a rule included in ChEBI. In addition to molecular entities, ChEBI
contains groups (parts of molecular entities) and classes of entities.
ChEBI includes an ontological classification, whereby the relationships
between molecular entities or classes of entities and their parents
and/or children are specified. ChEBI is available online at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/.
This article reports on new features in ChEBI since the last NAR
report in 2007, including substructure and similarity searching,
a submission tool for authoring of ChEBI datasets by the community
and a 30-fold increase in the number of chemical structures stored
in ChEBI.},

@article{Funahashi2008,
abstract = {Understanding of the logic and dynamics of gene-regulatory and biochemical networks is a major challenge of systems biology. To facilitate this research topic, we have developed a modeling/simulating tool called CellDesigner. CellDesigner primarily has capabilities to visualize, model, and simulate gene-regulatory and biochemical networks. Two major characteristics embedded in CellDesigner boost its usability to create/import/export models: 1) solidly defined and comprehensive graphical representation (systems biology graphical notation) of network models and 2) systems biology markup language (SBML) as a model-describing basis, which function as intertool media to import/export SBML-based models. In addition, since its initial release in 2004, we have extended various capabilities of CellDesigner. For example, we integrated other systems biology workbench enabled simulation/analysis software packages. CellDesigner also supports simulation and parameter search, supported by integration with SBML ODE Solver, enabling users to simulate through our sophisticated graphical user interface. Users can also browse and modify existing models by referring to existing databases directly through CellDesigner. Those extended functions empower CellDesigner as not only a modeling/simulating tool but also an integrated analysis suite. CellDesigner is implemented in Java and thus supports various platforms (i.e., Windows, Linux, and MacOS X). CellDesigner is freely available via our Web site.},

@article{Groenendyk2010,
abstract = {The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a multifunctional intracellular organelle supporting many processes required by virtually every mammalian cell, including cardiomyocytes. It performs diverse functions, including protein synthesis, translocation across the membrane, integration into the membrane, folding, posttranslational modification including N-linked glycosylation, and synthesis of phospholipids and steroids on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane, and regulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis. Perturbation of ER-associated functions results in ER stress via the activation of complex cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling pathways, collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) (also known as misfolded protein response), leading to upregulation of expression of ER resident chaperones, inhibition of protein synthesis and activation of protein degradation. The UPR has been associated with numerous human pathologies, and it may play an important role in the pathophysiology of the heart. ER stress responses, ER Ca(2+) buffering, and protein and lipid turnover impact many cardiac functions, including energy metabolism, cardiogenesis, ischemic/reperfusion, cardiomyopathies, and heart failure. ER proteins and ER stress-associated pathways may play a role in the development of novel UPR-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases.},
