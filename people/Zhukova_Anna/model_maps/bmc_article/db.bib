abstract = {Rhea (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/rhea) is a comprehensive resource of expert-curated biochemical reactions. Rhea provides a non-redundant set of chemical transformations for use in a broad spectrum of applications, including metabolic network reconstruction and pathway inference. Rhea includes enzyme-catalyzed reactions (covering the IUBMB Enzyme Nomenclature list), transport reactions and spontaneously occurring reactions. Rhea reactions are described using chemical species from the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest ontology (ChEBI) and are stoichiometrically balanced for mass and charge. They are extensively manually curated with links to source literature and other public resources on metabolism including enzyme and pathway databases. This cross-referencing facilitates the mapping and reconciliation of common reactions and compounds between distinct resources, which is a common first step in the reconstruction of genome scale metabolic networks and models.},

abstract = {The research by the information visualization community (“ Info Viz
”) shows clearly that using a visual representation of data-sets
enables faster analysis by the end users. Several scientific reasons
explain these results. First of all, the visual perception system
is the most powerful of all the human perception systems. In the
human brain, 70\% of the receptors and 40\% of the cortex are used
for the vision process [ 27 , 34 ]. Furthermore, human beings are
better at “recognition” tasks than at “memorization” tasks [ 10 ].
This implies that textual representations are less efficient than
visual metaphors when one wants to analyze huge data-sets. This comes
from the fact that reading is both a memorization task and a recognition
task.},

abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic models are built using information from an organism's annotated genome and, correspondingly, information on reactions catalyzed by the set of metabolic enzymes encoded by the genome. These models have been successfully applied to guide metabolic engineering to increase production of metabolites of industrial interest. Congruity between simulated and experimental metabolic behavior is influenced by the accuracy of the representation of the metabolic network in the model. In the interest of applying the consensus model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism for increased productivity of triglycerides, we manually evaluated the representation of fatty acid, glycerophospholipid, and glycerolipid metabolism in the consensus model (Yeast v6.0). These areas of metabolism were chosen due to their tightly interconnected nature to triglyceride synthesis. Manual curation was facilitated by custom MATLAB functions that return information contained in the model for reactions associated with genes and metabolites within the stated areas of metabolism. Through manual curation, we have identified inconsistencies between information contained in the model and literature knowledge. These inconsistencies include incorrect gene-reaction associations, improper definition of substrates/products in reactions, inappropriate assignments of reaction directionality, nonfunctional $\beta$-oxidation pathways, and missing reactions relevant to the synthesis and degradation of triglycerides. Suggestions to amend these inconsistencies in the Yeast v6.0 model can be implemented through a MATLAB script provided in the Supplementary Materials, Supplementary Data S1(Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/ind).},

This upper bound is the best possible, given information of just the vertices and the number of edges. Next we show that there exists an optimal partition in which one of the cliques is a maximal clique. Finally we present two new efficient methods to clique-partition a graph. Since the clique-partitioning of a graph is equivalent to the coloring of the complement of the graph, any coloring algorithm can also be used to clique-partition a graph. We present detailed statistics comparing the performance of our algorithms against two of the best known coloring algorithms and against a recently published clique-partitioning algorithm. Both functional and timing comparisons are given and we show that our algorithms compare very favorably on both counts.},

abstract = {Understanding of the logic and dynamics of gene-regulatory and biochemical networks is a major challenge of systems biology. To facilitate this research topic, we have developed a modeling/simulating tool called CellDesigner. CellDesigner primarily has capabilities to visualize, model, and simulate gene-regulatory and biochemical networks. Two major characteristics embedded in CellDesigner boost its usability to create/import/export models: 1) solidly defined and comprehensive graphical representation (systems biology graphical notation) of network models and 2) systems biology markup language (SBML) as a model-describing basis, which function as intertool media to import/export SBML-based models. In addition, since its initial release in 2004, we have extended various capabilities of CellDesigner. For example, we integrated other systems biology workbench enabled simulation/analysis software packages. CellDesigner also supports simulation and parameter search, supported by integration with SBML ODE Solver, enabling users to simulate through our sophisticated graphical user interface. Users can also browse and modify existing models by referring to existing databases directly through CellDesigner. Those extended functions empower CellDesigner as not only a modeling/simulating tool but also an integrated analysis suite. CellDesigner is implemented in Java and thus supports various platforms (i.e., Windows, Linux, and MacOS X). CellDesigner is freely available via our Web site.},

abstract = {The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a multifunctional intracellular organelle supporting many processes required by virtually every mammalian cell, including cardiomyocytes. It performs diverse functions, including protein synthesis, translocation across the membrane, integration into the membrane, folding, posttranslational modification including N-linked glycosylation, and synthesis of phospholipids and steroids on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane, and regulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis. Perturbation of ER-associated functions results in ER stress via the activation of complex cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling pathways, collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) (also known as misfolded protein response), leading to upregulation of expression of ER resident chaperones, inhibition of protein synthesis and activation of protein degradation. The UPR has been associated with numerous human pathologies, and it may play an important role in the pathophysiology of the heart. ER stress responses, ER Ca(2+) buffering, and protein and lipid turnover impact many cardiac functions, including energy metabolism, cardiogenesis, ischemic/reperfusion, cardiomyopathies, and heart failure. ER proteins and ER stress-associated pathways may play a role in the development of novel UPR-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases.},

abstract = {System-level analyses of microbial metabolism are facilitated by genome-scale reconstructions of microbial biochemical networks. A reconstruction provides a structured representation of the biochemical transformations occurring within an organism, as well as the genes necessary to carry out these transformations, as determined by the annotated genome sequence and experimental data. Network reconstructions also serve as platforms for constraint-based computational techniques, which facilitate biological studies in a variety of applications, including evaluation of network properties, metabolic engineering and drug discovery. Bottom-up metabolic network reconstructions have been developed for dozens of organisms, but until recently, the pace of reconstruction has failed to keep up with advances in genome sequencing. To address this problem, a number of software platforms have been developed to automate parts of the reconstruction process, thereby alleviating much of the manual effort previously required. Here, we review four such platforms in the context of established guidelines for network reconstruction. While many steps of the reconstruction process have been successfully automated, some manual evaluation of the results is still required to ensure a high-quality reconstruction. Widespread adoption of these platforms by the scientific community is underway and will be further enabled by exchangeable formats across platforms.},

abstract = {The Minimum Information Required in the Annotation of Models Registry (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam) provides unique, perennial and location-independent identifiers for data used in the biomedical domain. At its core is a shared catalogue of data collections, for each of which an individual namespace is created, and extensive metadata recorded. This namespace allows the generation of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to uniquely identify any record in a collection. Moreover, various services are provided to facilitate the creation and resolution of the identifiers. Since its launch in 2005, the system has evolved in terms of the structure of the identifiers provided, the software infrastructure, the number of data collections recorded, as well as the scope of the Registry itself. We describe here the new parallel identification scheme and the updated supporting software infrastructure. We also introduce the new Identifiers.org service (http://identifiers.org) that is built upon the information stored in the Registry and which provides directly resolvable identifiers, in the form of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). The flexibility of the identification scheme and resolving system allows its use in many different fields, where unambiguous and perennial identification of data entities are necessary.},

chemical and systemic functional information. In particular, gene
catalogs from completely sequenced genomes are linked to higher-level
systemic functions of the cell, the organism and the ecosystem. Major
efforts have been undertaken to manually create a knowledge base
for such systemic functions by capturing and organizing experimental
knowledge in computable forms; namely, in the forms of KEGG pathway
maps, BRITE functional hierarchies and KEGG modules. Continuous efforts
have also been made to develop and improve the cross-species annotation
procedure for linking genomes to the molecular networks through the
KEGG Orthology system. Here we report KEGG Mapper, a collection of
tools for KEGG PATHWAY, BRITE and MODULE mapping, enabling integration
and interpretation of large-scale data sets. We also report a variant
of the KEGG mapping procedure to extend the knowledge base, where
different types of data and knowledge, such as disease genes and
drug targets, are integrated as part of the KEGG molecular networks.
Finally, we describe recent enhancements to the KEGG content, especially
the incorporation of disease and drug information used in practice

Results: The Pathway Tools is a reusable, production-quality software environment for creating a type of MOD called a Pathway/Genome Database (PGDB). A PGDB such as EcoCyc (see http://ecocyc.org) integrates our evolving understanding of the genes, proteins, metabolic network, and genetic network of an organism. This paper provides an overview of the four main components of the Pathway Tools: The PathoLogic component supports creation of new PGDBs from the annotated genome of an organism. The Pathway/Genome Navigator provides query, visualization, and Web-publishing services for PGDBs. The Pathway/Genome Editors support interactive updating of PGDBs. The Pathway Tools ontology defines the schema of PGDBs. The Pathway Tools makes use of the Ocelot object database system for data management services for PGDBs. The Pathway Tools has been used to build PGDBs for 13 organisms within SRI and by external users.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Molecular biology knowledge can be formalized and systematically represented in a computer-readable form as a comprehensive map of molecular interactions. There exist an increasing number of maps of molecular interactions containing detailed and step-wise description of various cell mechanisms. It is difficult to explore these large maps, to organize discussion of their content and to maintain them. Several efforts were recently made to combine these capabilities together in one environment, and NaviCell is one of them.RESULTS:NaviCell is a web-based environment for exploiting large maps of molecular interactions, created in CellDesigner, allowing their easy exploration, curation and maintenance. It is characterized by a combination of three essential features: (1) efficient map browsing based on Google Maps; (2) semantic zooming for viewing different levels of details or of abstraction of the map and (3) integrated web-based blog for collecting community feedback. NaviCell can be easily used by experts in the field of molecular biology for studying molecular entities of interest in the context of signaling pathways and crosstalk between pathways within a global signaling network. NaviCell allows both exploration of detailed molecular mechanisms represented on the map and a more abstract view of the map up to a top-level modular representation. NaviCell greatly facilitates curation, maintenance and updating the comprehensive maps of molecular interactions in an interactive and user-friendly fashion due to an imbedded blogging system.CONCLUSIONS:NaviCell provides user-friendly exploration of large-scale maps of molecular interactions, thanks to Google Maps and WordPress interfaces, with which many users are already familiar. Semantic zooming which is used for navigating geographical maps is adopted for molecular maps in NaviCell, making any level of visualization readable. In addition, NaviCell provides a framework for community-based curation of maps.},

Description: We present a Web-based metabolic-map diagram, which can be interactively explored by the user, called the Cellular Overview. The main characteristic of this application is the zooming user interface enabling the user to focus on appropriate granularities of the network at will. Various searching commands are available to visually highlight sets of reactions, pathways, enzymes, metabolites, and so on. Expression data from single or multiple experiments can be overlaid on the diagram, which we call the Omics Viewer capability. The application provides Web services to highlight the diagram and to invoke the Omics Viewer. This application is entirely written in JavaScript for the client browsers and connect to a Pathway Tools Web server to retrieve data and diagrams. It uses the OpenLayers library to display tiled diagrams. Conclusions: This new online tool is capable of displaying large and complex metabolic-map diagrams in a very interactive manner.

as an important microorganism for several biotechnological processes,
such as the production of organic acids, lipases and proteases. It
is also considered a good candidate for single-cell oil production.
Although some of its metabolic pathways are well studied, its metabolic
engineering is hindered by the lack of a genome-scale model that
integrates the current knowledge about its metabolism.RESULTS:Combining
in silico tools and expert manual curation, we have produced an accurate
genome-scale metabolic model for Y. lipolytica. Using a scaffold
derived from a functional metabolic model of the well-studied but
phylogenetically distant yeast S. cerevisiae, we mapped conserved
reactions, rewrote gene associations, added species-specific reactions
and inflected specialized copies of scaffold reactions to account
for species-specific expansion of protein families. We used physiological
measures obtained under lab conditions to validate our predictions.CONCLUSIONS:Y.
lipolytica iNL895represents the first well-annotated metabolic model
of an oleaginous yeast, providing a reference for future metabolic
improvement, and a starting point for the metabolic reconstruction
of other species in the Yarrowia clade and other oleaginous yeasts.},

abstract = {The metabolic network is both a network of chemical reactions and a network of enzymes that catalyze reactions. Toward better understanding of this duality in the evolution of the metabolic network, we developed a method to extract conserved sequences of reactions called reaction modules from the analysis of chemical compound structure transformation patterns in all known metabolic pathways stored in the KEGG PATHWAY database. The extracted reaction modules are repeatedly used as if they are building blocks of the metabolic network and contain chemical logic of organic reactions. Furthermore, the reaction modules often correspond to traditional pathway modules defined as sets of enzymes in the KEGG MODULE database and sometimes to operon-like gene clusters in prokaryotic genomes. We identified well-conserved, possibly ancient, reaction modules involving 2-oxocarboxylic acids. The chain extension module that appears as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) reaction sequence in the TCA cycle is now shown to be used in other pathways together with different types of modification modules. We also identified reaction modules and their connection patterns for aromatic ring cleavages in microbial biodegradation pathways, which are most characteristic in terms of both distinct reaction sequences and distinct gene clusters. The modular architecture of biodegradation modules will have a potential for predicting degradation pathways of xenobiotic compounds. The collection of these and many other reaction modules is made available as part of the KEGG database.},

Leveraging on the exponential growth in sequenced genome availability, our method reconstructs genome-scale gapless metabolic networks simultaneously for a large number of species by integrating sequence data in a probabilistic framework. High reconstruction accuracy is demonstrated by comparisons to the well-curated Saccharomyces cerevisiae consensus model and large-scale knock-out experiments. Our comparative approach is particularly useful in scenarios where the quality of available sequence data is lacking, and when reconstructing evolutionary distant species. Moreover, the reconstructed networks are fully carbon mapped, allowing their use in 13C flux analysis. We demonstrate the functionality and usability of the reconstructed fungal models with computational steady-state biomass production experiment, as these fungi include some of the most important production organisms in industrial biotechnology. In contrast to many existing reconstruction techniques, only minimal manual effort is required before the reconstructed models are usable in flux balance experiments.

Recent work has shown that steps undertaken in reconstructing such metabolic networks are amenable to automation. The SuBliMinaL Toolbox (http://www.mcisb.org/subliminal/) facilitates the reconstruction process by providing a number of independent modules to perform common tasks, such as generating draft reconstructions, determining metabolite protonation state, mass and charge balancing reactions, suggesting intracellular compartmentalisation, adding transport reactions and a biomass function, and formatting the reconstruction to be used in third-party analysis packages. The individual modules manipulate reconstructions encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), and can be chained to generate a reconstruction pipeline, or used individually during a manual curation process. This work describes the individual modules themselves, and a study in which the modules were used to develop a metabolic reconstruction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from the existing data resources KEGG and MetaCyc. The automatically generated reconstruction is analysed for blocked reactions, and suggestions for future improvements to the toolbox are discussed.},

@article{Thiele2010,
abstract = {Network reconstructions are a common denominator in systems biology. Bottom-up metabolic network reconstructions have been developed over the last 10 years. These reconstructions represent structured knowledge bases that abstract pertinent information on the biochemical transformations taking place within specific target organisms. The conversion of a reconstruction into a mathematical format facilitates a myriad of computational biological studies, including evaluation of network content, hypothesis testing and generation, analysis of phenotypic characteristics and metabolic engineering. To date, genome-scale metabolic reconstructions for more than 30 organisms have been published and this number is expected to increase rapidly. However, these reconstructions differ in quality and coverage that may minimize their predictive potential and use as knowledge bases. Here we present a comprehensive protocol describing each step necessary to build a high-quality genome-scale metabolic reconstruction, as well as the common trials and tribulations. Therefore, this protocol provides a helpful manual for all stages of the reconstruction process.},

@article{Tohsato2000,
abstract = {In many of the chemical reactions in living cells, enzymes act as catalysts in the conversion of certain compounds (substrates) into other compounds (products). Comparative analyses of the metabolic pathways formed by such reactions give important information on their evolution and on pharmacological targets (Dandekar et al. 1999). Each of the enzymes that constitute a pathway is classified according to the EC (Enzyme Commission) numbering system, which consists of four sets of numbers that categorize the type of the chemical reaction catalyzed. In this study, we consider that reaction similarities can be expressed by the similarities between EC numbers of the respective enzymes. Therefore, in order to find a common pattern among pathways, it is desirable to be able to use the functional hierarchy of EC numbers to express the reaction similarities. In this paper, we propose a multiple alignment algorithm utilizing information content that is extended to symbols having a hierarchical structure. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by applying the method to pathway analyses of sugar, DNA and amino acid metabolisms.},

abstract = {This book shows how to look at ways of visualizing large datasets, whether large in numbers of cases, or large in numbers of variables, or large in both. All ideas are illustrated with displays from analyses of real datasets and the importance of interpreting displays effectively is emphasized. Graphics should be drawn to convey information and the book includes many insightful examples. New approaches to graphics are needed to visualize the information in large datasets and most of the innovations described in this book are developments of standard graphics. The book is accessible to readers with some experience of drawing statistical graphics.},

abstract = {The complex process of genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction involves semi-automatic reaction inference, analysis, and refinement through curation by human experts. Unfortunately, decisions by experts are hampered by the complexity of the network, which can mask errors in the inferred network. In order to aid an expert in making sense out of the thousands of reactions in the organism's metabolism, we developed a method for knowledge-based generalization that provides a higher-level view of the network, highlighting the particularities and essential structure, while hiding the details. In this study, we show the application of this generalization method to 1,286 metabolic networks of organisms in Path2Models that describe fatty acid metabolism. We compare the generalised networks and show that we successfully highlight the aspects that are important for their curation and comparison.},
