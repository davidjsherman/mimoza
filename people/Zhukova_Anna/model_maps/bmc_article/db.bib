abstract = {The use of computational modeling to describe and analyze biological systems is at the heart of systems biology. Model structures, simulation descriptions and numerical results can be encoded in structured formats, but there is an increasing need to provide an additional semantic layer. Semantic information adds meaning to components of structured descriptions to help identify and interpret them unambiguously. Ontologies are one of the tools frequently used for this purpose. We describe here three ontologies created specifically to address the needs of the systems biology community. The Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) provides semantic information about the model components. The Kinetic Simulation Algorithm Ontology (KiSAO) supplies information about existing algorithms available for the simulation of systems biology models, their characterization and interrelationships. The Terminology for the Description of Dynamics (TEDDY) categorizes dynamical features of the simulation results and general systems behavior. The provision of semantic information extends a model's longevity and facilitates its reuse. It provides useful insight into the biology of modeled processes, and may be used to make informed decisions on subsequent simulation experiments.},

abstract = {The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a multifunctional intracellular organelle supporting many processes required by virtually every mammalian cell, including cardiomyocytes. It performs diverse functions, including protein synthesis, translocation across the membrane, integration into the membrane, folding, posttranslational modification including N-linked glycosylation, and synthesis of phospholipids and steroids on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane, and regulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis. Perturbation of ER-associated functions results in ER stress via the activation of complex cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling pathways, collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) (also known as misfolded protein response), leading to upregulation of expression of ER resident chaperones, inhibition of protein synthesis and activation of protein degradation. The UPR has been associated with numerous human pathologies, and it may play an important role in the pathophysiology of the heart. ER stress responses, ER Ca(2+) buffering, and protein and lipid turnover impact many cardiac functions, including energy metabolism, cardiogenesis, ischemic/reperfusion, cardiomyopathies, and heart failure. ER proteins and ER stress-associated pathways may play a role in the development of novel UPR-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases.},

abstract = {Understanding of the logic and dynamics of gene-regulatory and biochemical networks is a major challenge of systems biology. To facilitate this research topic, we have developed a modeling/simulating tool called CellDesigner. CellDesigner primarily has capabilities to visualize, model, and simulate gene-regulatory and biochemical networks. Two major characteristics embedded in CellDesigner boost its usability to create/import/export models: 1) solidly defined and comprehensive graphical representation (systems biology graphical notation) of network models and 2) systems biology markup language (SBML) as a model-describing basis, which function as intertool media to import/export SBML-based models. In addition, since its initial release in 2004, we have extended various capabilities of CellDesigner. For example, we integrated other systems biology workbench enabled simulation/analysis software packages. CellDesigner also supports simulation and parameter search, supported by integration with SBML ODE Solver, enabling users to simulate through our sophisticated graphical user interface. Users can also browse and modify existing models by referring to existing databases directly through CellDesigner. Those extended functions empower CellDesigner as not only a modeling/simulating tool but also an integrated analysis suite. CellDesigner is implemented in Java and thus supports various platforms (i.e., Windows, Linux, and MacOS X). CellDesigner is freely available via our Web site.},

Leveraging on the exponential growth in sequenced genome availability, our method reconstructs genome-scale gapless metabolic networks simultaneously for a large number of species by integrating sequence data in a probabilistic framework. High reconstruction accuracy is demonstrated by comparisons to the well-curated Saccharomyces cerevisiae consensus model and large-scale knock-out experiments. Our comparative approach is particularly useful in scenarios where the quality of available sequence data is lacking, and when reconstructing evolutionary distant species. Moreover, the reconstructed networks are fully carbon mapped, allowing their use in 13C flux analysis. We demonstrate the functionality and usability of the reconstructed fungal models with computational steady-state biomass production experiment, as these fungi include some of the most important production organisms in industrial biotechnology. In contrast to many existing reconstruction techniques, only minimal manual effort is required before the reconstructed models are usable in flux balance experiments.

abstract = {System-level analyses of microbial metabolism are facilitated by genome-scale reconstructions of microbial biochemical networks. A reconstruction provides a structured representation of the biochemical transformations occurring within an organism, as well as the genes necessary to carry out these transformations, as determined by the annotated genome sequence and experimental data. Network reconstructions also serve as platforms for constraint-based computational techniques, which facilitate biological studies in a variety of applications, including evaluation of network properties, metabolic engineering and drug discovery. Bottom-up metabolic network reconstructions have been developed for dozens of organisms, but until recently, the pace of reconstruction has failed to keep up with advances in genome sequencing. To address this problem, a number of software platforms have been developed to automate parts of the reconstruction process, thereby alleviating much of the manual effort previously required. Here, we review four such platforms in the context of established guidelines for network reconstruction. While many steps of the reconstruction process have been successfully automated, some manual evaluation of the results is still required to ensure a high-quality reconstruction. Widespread adoption of these platforms by the scientific community is underway and will be further enabled by exchangeable formats across platforms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Development of cells with minimal metabolic functionality is gaining importance due to their efficiency in producing chemicals and fuels. Existing computational methods to identify minimal reaction sets in metabolic networks are computationally expensive. Further, they identify only one of the several possible minimal reaction sets.RESULTS:In this paper, we propose an efficient graph theory based recursive optimization approach to identify all minimal reaction sets. Graph theoretical insights offer systematic methods to not only reduce the number of variables in math programming and increase its computational efficiency, but also provide efficient ways to find multiple optimal solutions. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated using case studies from Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In case study 1, the proposed method identified three minimal reaction sets each containing 38 reactions in Escherichia coli central metabolic network with 77 reactions. Analysis of these three minimal reaction sets revealed that one of them is more suitable for developing minimal metabolism cell compared to other two due to practically achievable internal flux distribution. In case study 2, the proposed method identified 256 minimal reaction sets from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome scale metabolic network with 620 reactions. The proposed method required only 4.5 hours to identify all the 256 minimal reaction sets and has shown a significant reduction (approximately 80\%) in the solution time when compared to the existing methods for finding minimal reaction set.CONCLUSIONS:Identification of all minimal reactions sets in metabolic networks is essential since different minimal reaction sets have different properties that effect the bioprocess development. The proposed method correctly identified all minimal reaction sets in a both the case studies. The proposed method is computationally efficient compared to other methods for finding minimal reaction sets and useful to employ with genome-scale metabolic networks.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:When studying metabolism at the organ level, a major challenge is to understand the matter exchanges between the input and output components of the system. For example, in nutrition, biochemical models have been developed to study the metabolism of the mammary gland in relation to the synthesis of milk components. These models were designed to account for the quantitative constraints observed on inputs and outputs of the system. In these models, a compatible flux distribution is first selected. Alternatively, an infinite family of compatible set of flux rates may have to be studied when the constraints raised by observations are insufficient to identify a single flux distribution. The precursors of output nutrients are traced back with analyses similar to the computation of yield rates. However, the computation of the quantitative contributions of precursors may lack precision, mainly because some precursors are involved in the composition of several nutrients and because some metabolites are cycled in loops.RESULTS:We formally modeled the quantitative allocation of input nutrients among the branches of the metabolic network (AIO). It corresponds to yield information which, if standardized across all the outputs of the system, allows a precise quantitative understanding of their precursors. By solving nonlinear optimization problems, we introduced a method to study the variability of AIO coefficients when parsing the space of flux distributions that are compatible with both model stoichiometry and experimental data. Applied to a model of the metabolism of the mammary gland, our method made it possible to distinguish the effects of different nutritional treatments, although it cannot be proved that the mammary gland optimizes a specific linear combination of flux variables, including those based on energy. Altogether, our study indicated that the mammary gland possesses considerable metabolic flexibility.CONCLUSION:Our method enables to study the variability of a metabolic network with respect to efficiency (i.e. yield rates). It allows a quantitative comparison of the respective contributions of precursors to the production of a set of nutrients by a metabolic network, regardless of the choice of the flux distribution within the different branches of the network.},

Reconstructed models may contain inconsistencies that appear as gap metabolites and blocked reactions. Although automatic methods for solving this problem have been previously developed, there are many situations where manual curation is still needed.

RESULTS: We introduce a general definition of gap metabolite that allows its detection in a straightforward manner. Moreover, a method for the detection of Unconnected Modules, defined as isolated sets of blocked reactions connected through gap metabolites, is proposed. The method has been successfully applied to the curation of iCG238, the genome-scale metabolic model for the bacterium Blattabacterium cuenoti, obligate endosymbiont of cockroaches.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) provides standard graphical languages for representing cellular processes, interactions, and biological networks. SBGN consists of three languages: Process Descriptions (PD), Entity Relationships (ER), and Activity Flows (AF). Maps in SBGN PD are often large, detailed, and complex, therefore there is a need for a simplified illustration.

RESULTS: To solve this problem we define translations of SBGN PD maps into the more abstract SBGN AF maps. We present a template-based translation which allows the user to focus on different aspects of the underlying biological system. We also discuss aspects of laying out the AF map and of interactive navigation between both the PD and the AF map. The methods developed here have been implemented as part of SBGN-ED (http://www.sbgn-ed.org).

CONCLUSIONS: SBGN PD maps become much smaller and more manageable when translated into SBGN AF. The flexible translation of PD into AF and related interaction methods are an initial step in translating the different SBGN languages and open the path to future research for translation methods between other SBGN languages.},

@article{Buchel2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systems biology projects and omics technologies have led to a growing number of biochemical pathway models and reconstructions. However, the majority of these models are still created de novo, based on literature mining and the manual processing of pathway data.

RESULTS: To increase the efficiency of model creation, the Path2Models project has automatically generated mathematical models from pathway representations using a suite of freely available software. Data sources include KEGG, BioCarta, MetaCyc and SABIO-RK. Depending on the source data, three types of models are provided: kinetic, logical and constraint-based. Models from over 2 600 organisms are encoded consistently in SBML, and are made freely available through BioModels Database at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/path2models. Each model contains the list of participants, their interactions, the relevant mathematical constructs, and initial parameter values. Most models are also available as easy-to-understand graphical SBGN maps.

CONCLUSIONS: To date, the project has resulted in more than 140 000 freely available models. Such a resource can tremendously accelerate the development of mathematical models by providing initial starting models for simulation and analysis, which can be subsequently curated and further parameterized.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enzymes belonging to mechanistically diverse superfamilies often display similar catalytic mechanisms. We previously observed such an association in the case of the cyclic amidohydrolase superfamily whose members play a role in related steps of purine and pyrimidine metabolic pathways. To establish a possible link between enzyme homology and chemical similarity, we investigated further the neighbouring steps in the respective pathways.

RESULTS: We identified that successive reactions of the purine and pyrimidine pathways display similar chemistry. These mechanistically-related reactions are often catalyzed by homologous enzymes. Detection of series of similar catalysis made by succeeding enzyme families suggested some modularity in the architecture of the central metabolism. Accordingly, we introduce the concept of a reaction module to define at least two successive steps catalyzed by homologous enzymes in pathways alignable by similar chemical reactions. Applying such a concept allowed us to propose new function for misannotated paralogues. In particular, we discovered a putative ureidoglycine carbamoyltransferase (UGTCase) activity. Finally, we present experimental data supporting the conclusion that this UGTCase is likely to be involved in a new route in purine catabolism.

CONCLUSIONS: Using the reaction module concept should be of great value. It will help us to trace how the primordial promiscuous enzymes were assembled progressively in functional modules, as the present pathways diverged from ancestral pathways to give birth to the present-day mechanistically diversified superfamilies. In addition, the concept allows the determination of the actual function of misannotated proteins.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Molecular biology knowledge can be formalized and systematically represented in a computer-readable form as a comprehensive map of molecular interactions. There exist an increasing number of maps of molecular interactions containing detailed and step-wise description of various cell mechanisms. It is difficult to explore these large maps, to organize discussion of their content and to maintain them. Several efforts were recently made to combine these capabilities together in one environment, and NaviCell is one of them.RESULTS:NaviCell is a web-based environment for exploiting large maps of molecular interactions, created in CellDesigner, allowing their easy exploration, curation and maintenance. It is characterized by a combination of three essential features: (1) efficient map browsing based on Google Maps; (2) semantic zooming for viewing different levels of details or of abstraction of the map and (3) integrated web-based blog for collecting community feedback. NaviCell can be easily used by experts in the field of molecular biology for studying molecular entities of interest in the context of signaling pathways and crosstalk between pathways within a global signaling network. NaviCell allows both exploration of detailed molecular mechanisms represented on the map and a more abstract view of the map up to a top-level modular representation. NaviCell greatly facilitates curation, maintenance and updating the comprehensive maps of molecular interactions in an interactive and user-friendly fashion due to an imbedded blogging system.CONCLUSIONS:NaviCell provides user-friendly exploration of large-scale maps of molecular interactions, thanks to Google Maps and WordPress interfaces, with which many users are already familiar. Semantic zooming which is used for navigating geographical maps is adopted for molecular maps in NaviCell, making any level of visualization readable. In addition, NaviCell provides a framework for community-based curation of maps.},

@article{Palsson2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The complexity and multiscale nature of the mammalian immune response provides an excellent test bed for the potential of mathematical modeling and simulation to facilitate mechanistic understanding. Historically, mathematical models of the immune response focused on subsets of the immune system and/or specific aspects of the response. Mathematical models have been developed for the humoral side of the immune response, or for the cellular side, or for cytokine kinetics, but rarely have they been proposed to encompass the overall system complexity. We propose here a framework for integration of subset models, based on a system biology approach.

RESULTS: A dynamic simulator, the Fully-integrated Immune Response Model (FIRM), was built in a stepwise fashion by integrating published subset models and adding novel features. The approach used to build the model includes the formulation of the network of interacting species and the subsequent introduction of rate laws to describe each biological process. The resulting model represents a multi-organ structure, comprised of the target organ where the immune response takes place, circulating blood, lymphoid T, and lymphoid B tissue. The cell types accounted for include macrophages, a few T-cell lineages (cytotoxic, regulatory, helper 1, and helper 2), and B-cell activation to plasma cells. Four different cytokines were accounted for: IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-12. In addition, generic inflammatory signals are used to represent the kinetics of IL-1, IL-2, and TGF-beta. Cell recruitment, differentiation, replication, apoptosis and migration are described as appropriate for the different cell types. The model is a hybrid structure containing information from several mammalian species. The structure of the network was built to be physiologically and biochemically consistent. Rate laws for all the cellular fate processes, growth factor production rates and half-lives, together with antibody production rates and half-lives, are provided. The results demonstrate how this framework can be used to integrate mathematical models of the immune response from several published sources and describe qualitative predictions of global immune system response arising from the integrated, hybrid model. In addition, we show how the model can be expanded to include novel biological findings. Case studies were carried out to simulate TB infection, tumor rejection, response to a blood borne pathogen and the consequences of accounting for regulatory T-cells.

CONCLUSIONS: The final result of this work is a postulated and increasingly comprehensive representation of the mammalian immune system, based on physiological knowledge and susceptible to further experimental testing and validation. We believe that the integrated nature of FIRM has the potential to simulate a range of responses under a variety of conditions, from modeling of immune responses after tuberculosis (TB) infection to tumor formation in tissues. FIRM also has the flexibility to be expanded to include both complex and novel immunological response features as our knowledge of the immune system advances.},

@article{Klapa2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:Understanding the topology and dynamics of the human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network will significantly contribute to biomedical research, therefore its systematic reconstruction is required. Several meta-databases integrate source PPI datasets, but the protein node sets of their networks vary depending on the PPI data combined. Due to this inherent heterogeneity, the way in which the human PPI network expands via multiple dataset integration has not been comprehensively analyzed. We aim at assembling the human interactome in a global structured way and exploring it to gain insights of biological relevance.RESULTS:First, we defined the UniProtKB manually reviewed human "complete" proteome as the reference protein-node set and then we mined five major source PPI datasets for direct PPIs exclusively between the reference proteins. We updated the protein and publication identifiers and normalized all PPIs to the UniProt identifier level. The reconstructed interactome covers approximately 60\% of the human proteome and has a scale-free structure. No apparent differentiating gene functional classification characteristics were identified for the unrepresented proteins. The source dataset integration augments the network mainly in PPIs. Polyubiquitin emerged as the highest-degree node, but the inclusion of most of the identified PPIs may be reconsidered. The high number (>300) of connections of the subsequent fifteen proteins correlates well with their essential biological role. According to the power-law network structure, the unrepresented proteins should mainly have up to four connections with equally poorly-connected interactors.CONCLUSIONS:Reconstructing the human interactome based on the a priori definition of the protein nodes enabled us to identify the currently included part of the human "complete" proteome, and discuss the role of the proteins within the network topology with respect to their function. As the network expansion has to comply with the scale-free theory, we suggest that the core of the human interactome has essentially emerged. Thus, it could be employed in systems biology and biomedical research, despite the considerable number of currently unrepresented proteins. The latter are probably involved in specialized physiological conditions, justifying the scarcity of related PPI information, and their identification can assist in designing relevant functional experiments and targeted text mining algorithms.},

We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery.},

abstract = {Fatty acids (FAs) are major building blocks of membrane phospholipids in bacteria and eukaryotes. Their presumed absence in archaea led to propose a late origin in bacteria and eukaryotes and that the last common ancestor of living organisms (the cenancestor) was devoid of both FA and phospholipid membranes. However, small FA amounts and homologs of bacterial FA biosynthesis enzymes are found in archaea. We have investigated the origin of these archaeal enzymes using phylogenomic analyses of all enzymes of the main bacterial FA biosynthesis pathway. Our results suggest that modern archaea and their last common ancestor possessed a complete pathway except for the acyl carrier protein (ACP) processing machinery, which evolved in the bacterial lineage. This has not only implications for archaeal physiology but also opens the possibility for the presence of ACP-independent FA synthesis in the cenancestor, which may have been endowed with FA-phospholipid membranes.},

@article{Sun2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:A necessary step for a genome level analysis of the cellular metabolism is the in silico reconstruction of the metabolic network from genome sequences. The available methods are mainly based on the annotation of genome sequences including two successive steps, the prediction of coding sequences (CDS) and their function assignment. The annotation process takes time. The available methods often encounter difficulties when dealing with unfinished error-containing genomic sequence.RESULTS:In this work a fast method is proposed to use unannotated genome sequence for predicting CDSs and for an in silico reconstruction of metabolic networks. Instead of using predicted genes or CDSs to query public databases, entries from public DNA or protein databases are used as queries to search a local database of the unannotated genome sequence to predict CDSs. Functions are assigned to the predicted CDSs simultaneously. The well-annotated genome of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 is used as an example to demonstrate the applicability of the method. 97.7\% of the CDSs in the original annotation are correctly identified. The use of SWISS-PROT-TrEMBL databases resulted in an identification of 98.9\% of CDSs that have EC-numbers in the published annotation. Furthermore, two versions of sequences of the bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae with different genome coverage (3.9 and 7.9 fold, respectively) are examined. The results suggest that a 3.9-fold coverage of the bacterial genome could be sufficiently used for the in silico reconstruction of the metabolic network. Compared to other gene finding methods such as CRITICA our method is more suitable for exploiting sequences of low genome coverage. Based on the new method, a program called IdentiCS (Identification of Coding Sequences from Unfinished Genome Sequences) is delivered that combines the identification of CDSs with the reconstruction, comparison and visualization of metabolic networks (free to download at http://genome.gbf.de/bioinformatics/index.html webcite).CONCLUSIONS:The reversed querying process and the program IdentiCS allow a fast and adequate prediction protein coding sequences and reconstruction of the potential metabolic network from low coverage genome sequences of bacteria. The new method can accelerate the use of genomic data for studying cellular metabolism.},

Results: The Pathway Tools is a reusable, production-quality software environment for creating a type of MOD called a Pathway/Genome Database (PGDB). A PGDB such as EcoCyc (see http://ecocyc.org) integrates our evolving understanding of the genes, proteins, metabolic network, and genetic network of an organism. This paper provides an overview of the four main components of the Pathway Tools: The PathoLogic component supports creation of new PGDBs from the annotated genome of an organism. The Pathway/Genome Navigator provides query, visualization, and Web-publishing services for PGDBs. The Pathway/Genome Editors support interactive updating of PGDBs. The Pathway Tools ontology defines the schema of PGDBs. The Pathway Tools makes use of the Ocelot object database system for data management services for PGDBs.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions under the Constraint Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) framework are valuable tools for analyzing the metabolic capabilities of organisms and interpreting experimental data. As the number of such reconstructions and analysis methods increases, there is a greater need for data uniformity and ease of distribution and use.

DESCRIPTION: We describe BiGG, a knowledgebase of Biochemically, Genetically and Genomically structured genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions. BiGG integrates several published genome-scale metabolic networks into one resource with standard nomenclature which allows components to be compared across different organisms. BiGG can be used to browse model content, visualize metabolic pathway maps, and export SBML files of the models for further analysis by external software packages. Users may follow links from BiGG to several external databases to obtain additional information on genes, proteins, reactions, metabolites and citations of interest.

CONCLUSIONS: BiGG addresses a need in the systems biology community to have access to high quality curated metabolic models and reconstructions. It is freely available for academic use at http://bigg.ucsd.edu.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Gene Ontology (GO) facilitates the description of the action of gene products in a biological context. Many GO terms refer to chemical entities that participate in biological processes. To facilitate accurate and consistent systems-wide biological representation, it is necessary to integrate the chemical view of these entities with the biological view of GO functions and processes. We describe a collaborative effort between the GO and the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) ontology developers to ensure that the representation of chemicals in the GO is both internally consistent and in alignment with the chemical expertise captured in ChEBI.

RESULTS: We have examined and integrated the ChEBI structural hierarchy into the GO resource through computationally-assisted manual curation of both GO and ChEBI. Our work has resulted in the creation of computable definitions of GO terms that contain fully defined semantic relationships to corresponding chemical terms in ChEBI.

CONCLUSIONS: The set of logical definitions using both the GO and ChEBI has already been used to automate aspects of GO development and has the potential to allow the integration of data across the domains of biology and chemistry. These logical definitions are available as an extended version of the ontology from http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go/extensions/go-plus.owl.},

abstract = {The Minimum Information Required in the Annotation of Models Registry (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam) provides unique, perennial and location-independent identifiers for data used in the biomedical domain. At its core is a shared catalogue of data collections, for each of which an individual namespace is created, and extensive metadata recorded. This namespace allows the generation of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to uniquely identify any record in a collection. Moreover, various services are provided to facilitate the creation and resolution of the identifiers. Since its launch in 2005, the system has evolved in terms of the structure of the identifiers provided, the software infrastructure, the number of data collections recorded, as well as the scope of the Registry itself. We describe here the new parallel identification scheme and the updated supporting software infrastructure. We also introduce the new Identifiers.org service (http://identifiers.org) that is built upon the information stored in the Registry and which provides directly resolvable identifiers, in the form of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). The flexibility of the identification scheme and resolving system allows its use in many different fields, where unambiguous and perennial identification of data entities are necessary.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biological processes such as metabolism, signaling, and macromolecular synthesis can be modeled as large networks of biochemical reactions. Large and comprehensive networks, like integrated networks that represent metabolism and macromolecular synthesis, are inherently multiscale because reaction rates can vary over many orders of magnitude. They require special methods for accurate analysis because naive use of standard optimization systems can produce inaccurate or erroneously infeasible results. RESULTS: We describe techniques enabling off-the-shelf optimization software to compute accurate solutions to the poorly scaled optimization problems arising from flux balance analysis of multiscale biochemical reaction networks. We implement lifting techniques for flux balance analysis within the openCOBRA toolbox and demonstrate our techniques using the first integrated reconstruction of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis for E. coli. CONCLUSION: Our techniques enable accurate flux balance analysis of multiscale networks using off-the-shelf optimization software. Although we describe lifting techniques in the context of flux balance analysis, our methods can be used to handle a variety of optimization problems arising from analysis of multiscale network reconstructions.},

abstract = {In many of the chemical reactions in living cells, enzymes act as catalysts in the conversion of certain compounds (substrates) into other compounds (products). Comparative analyses of the metabolic pathways formed by such reactions give important information on their evolution and on pharmacological targets (Dandekar et al. 1999). Each of the enzymes that constitute a pathway is classified according to the EC (Enzyme Commission) numbering system, which consists of four sets of numbers that categorize the type of the chemical reaction catalyzed. In this study, we consider that reaction similarities can be expressed by the similarities between EC numbers of the respective enzymes. Therefore, in order to find a common pattern among pathways, it is desirable to be able to use the functional hierarchy of EC numbers to express the reaction similarities. In this paper, we propose a multiple alignment algorithm utilizing information content that is extended to symbols having a hierarchical structure. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by applying the method to pathway analyses of sugar, DNA and amino acid metabolisms.},

abstract = {The metabolic network is both a network of chemical reactions and a network of enzymes that catalyze reactions. Toward better understanding of this duality in the evolution of the metabolic network, we developed a method to extract conserved sequences of reactions called reaction modules from the analysis of chemical compound structure transformation patterns in all known metabolic pathways stored in the KEGG PATHWAY database. The extracted reaction modules are repeatedly used as if they are building blocks of the metabolic network and contain chemical logic of organic reactions. Furthermore, the reaction modules often correspond to traditional pathway modules defined as sets of enzymes in the KEGG MODULE database and sometimes to operon-like gene clusters in prokaryotic genomes. We identified well-conserved, possibly ancient, reaction modules involving 2-oxocarboxylic acids. The chain extension module that appears as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) reaction sequence in the TCA cycle is now shown to be used in other pathways together with different types of modification modules. We also identified reaction modules and their connection patterns for aromatic ring cleavages in microbial biodegradation pathways, which are most characteristic in terms of both distinct reaction sequences and distinct gene clusters. The modular architecture of biodegradation modules will have a potential for predicting degradation pathways of xenobiotic compounds. The collection of these and many other reaction modules is made available as part of the KEGG database.},

abstract = {The generation and use of metabolic network reconstructions has increased over recent years. The development of such reconstructions has typically involved a time-consuming, manual process. Recent work has shown that steps undertaken in reconstructing such metabolic networks are amenable to automation. The SuBliMinaL Toolbox (http://www.mcisb.org/subliminal/) facilitates the reconstruction process by providing a number of independent modules to perform common tasks, such as generating draft reconstructions, determining metabolite protonation state, mass and charge balancing reactions, suggesting intracellular compartmentalisation, adding transport reactions and a biomass function, and formatting the reconstruction to be used in third-party analysis packages. The individual modules manipulate reconstructions encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), and can be chained to generate a reconstruction pipeline, or used individually during a manual curation process. This work describes the individual modules themselves, and a study in which the modules were used to develop a metabolic reconstruction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from the existing data resources KEGG and MetaCyc. The automatically generated reconstruction is analysed for blocked reactions, and suggestions for future improvements to the toolbox are discussed.},

abstract = {Network reconstructions are a common denominator in systems biology. Bottom-up metabolic network reconstructions have been developed over the last 10 years. These reconstructions represent structured knowledge bases that abstract pertinent information on the biochemical transformations taking place within specific target organisms. The conversion of a reconstruction into a mathematical format facilitates a myriad of computational biological studies, including evaluation of network content, hypothesis testing and generation, analysis of phenotypic characteristics and metabolic engineering. To date, genome-scale metabolic reconstructions for more than 30 organisms have been published and this number is expected to increase rapidly. However, these reconstructions differ in quality and coverage that may minimize their predictive potential and use as knowledge bases. Here we present a comprehensive protocol describing each step necessary to build a high-quality genome-scale metabolic reconstruction, as well as the common trials and tribulations. Therefore, this protocol provides a helpful manual for all stages of the reconstruction process.},

abstract = {The metabolic network in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was reconstructed using currently available genomic, biochemical, and physiological information. The metabolic reactions were compartmentalized between the cytosol and the mitochondria, and transport steps between the compartments and the environment were included. A total of 708 structural open reading frames (ORFs) were accounted for in the reconstructed network, corresponding to 1035 metabolic reactions. Further, 140 reactions were included on the basis of biochemical evidence resulting in a genome-scale reconstructed metabolic network containing 1175 metabolic reactions and 584 metabolites. The number of gene functions included in the reconstructed network corresponds to approximately 16\% of all characterized ORFs in S. cerevisiae. Using the reconstructed network, the metabolic capabilities of S. cerevisiae were calculated and compared with Escherichia coli. The reconstructed metabolic network is the first comprehensive network for a eukaryotic organism, and it may be used as the basis for in silico analysis of phenotypic functions.},

Next we show that there exists an optimal partition in which one of the cliques is a maximal clique. Finally we present two new efficient methods to clique-partition a graph. Since the clique-partitioning of a graph is equivalent to the coloring of the complement of the graph, any coloring algorithm can also be used to clique-partition a graph. We present detailed statistics comparing the performance of our algorithms against two of the best known coloring algorithms and against a recently published clique-partitioning algorithm. Both functional and timing comparisons are given and we show that our algorithms compare very favorably on both counts.},

These include signaling, gene regulatory, and metabolic networks. However, most of these models are specific to each kind of network. Their interconnection demands a whole-cell modeling framework for a complete understanding of cellular systems. We describe the features required by an integrated framework for modeling, analyzing and simulating biological processes, and review several modeling formalisms that have been used in Systems Biology including Boolean networks, Bayesian networks, Petri nets, process algebras, constraint-based models, differential equations, rule-based models, interacting state machines, cellular automata, and agent-based models. We compare the features provided by different formalisms, and discuss recent approaches in the integration of these formalisms, as well as possible directions for the future.},

Description: We present a Web-based metabolic-map diagram, which can be interactively explored by the user, called the Cellular Overview. The main characteristic of this application is the zooming user interface enabling the user to focus on appropriate granularities of the network at will. Various searching commands are available to visually highlight sets of reactions, pathways, enzymes, metabolites, and so on. Expression data from single or multiple experiments can be overlaid on the diagram, which we call the Omics Viewer capability. The application provides Web services to highlight the diagram and to invoke the Omics Viewer. This application is entirely written in JavaScript for the client browsers and connect to a Pathway Tools Web server to retrieve data and diagrams. It uses the OpenLayers library to display tiled diagrams. Conclusions: This new online tool is capable of displaying large and complex metabolic-map diagrams in a very interactive manner. This application is available as part of the Pathway Tools software that powers multiple metabolic databases including Biocyc.org: The Cellular Overview is accessible under the Tools menu.},

@article{Singh2006,
abstract = {Background: Targeting persistent tubercule bacilli has become an important challenge in the development of anti-tuberculous drugs. As the glyoxylate bypass is essential for persistent bacilli, interference with it holds the potential for designing new antibacterial drugs. We have developed kinetic models of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glyoxylate bypass in Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and studied the effects of inhibition of various enzymes in the M. tuberculosis model. Results: We used E. coli to validate the pathway-modeling protocol and showed that changes in metabolic flux can be estimated from gene expression data. The M. tuberculosis model reproduced the observation that deletion of one of the two isocitrate lyase genes has little effect on bacterial growth in macrophages, but deletion of both genes leads to the elimination of the bacilli from the lungs. It also substantiated the inhibition of isocitrate lyases by 3-nitropropionate. On the basis of our simulation studies, we propose that: (i) fractional inactivation of both isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 is required for a flux through the glyoxylate bypass in persistent mycobacteria; and (ii) increasing the amount of active isocitrate dehydrogenases can stop the flux through the glyoxylate bypass, so the kinase that inactivates isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and/or the proposed inactivator of isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 is a potential target for drugs against persistent mycobacteria. In addition, competitive inhibition of isocitrate lyases along with a reduction in the inactivation of isocitrate dehydrogenases appears to be a feasible strategy for targeting persistent mycobacteria. Conclusion: We used kinetic modeling of biochemical pathways to assess various potential anti-tuberculous drug targets that interfere with the glyoxylate bypass flux, and indicated the type of inhibition needed to eliminate the pathogen. The advantage of such an approach to the assessment of drug targets is that it facilitates the study of systemic effect(s) of the modulation of the target enzyme(s) in the cellular environment.},

Version 2.0 of the COBRA Toolbox expands the scope of computations by including in silico analysis methods developed since its original release. New functions include (i) network gap filling, (ii) (13)C analysis, (iii) metabolic engineering, (iv) omics-guided analysis and (v) visualization. As with the first version, the COBRA Toolbox reads and writes systems biology markup language-formatted models. In version 2.0, we improved performance, usability and the level of documentation. A suite of test scripts can now be used to learn the core functionality of the toolbox and validate results. This toolbox lowers the barrier of entry to use powerful COBRA methods.},

An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery.},

abstract = {First, the span of absolute judgment and the span of immediate memory impose severe limitations on the amount of information that we are able to receive, process, and remember. By organizing the stimulus input simultaneously into several dimensions and successively into a sequence or chunks, we manage to break (or at least stretch) this informational bottleneck. Second, the process of recoding is a very important one in human psychology and deserves much more explicit attention than it has received. In particular, the kind of linguistic recoding that people do seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes. Recoding procedures are a constant concern to clinicians, social psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists and yet, probably because recoding is less accessible to experimental manipulation than nonsense syllables or T mazes, the traditional experimental psychologist has contributed little or nothing to their analysis. Nevertheless, experimental techniques can be used, methods of recoding can be specified, behavioral indicants can be found. And I anticipate that we will find a very orderly set of relations describing what now seems an uncharted wilderness of individual differences. Third, the concepts and measures provided by the theory of information provide a quantitative way of getting at some of these questions. The theory provides us with a yardstick for calibrating our stimulus materials and for measuring the performance of our subjects. In the interests of communication I have suppressed the technical details of information measurement and have tried to express the ideas in more familiar terms; I hope this paraphrase will not lead you to think they are not useful in research. Informational concepts have already proved valuable in the study of discrimination and of language; they promise a great deal in the study of learning and memory; and it has even been proposed that they can be useful in the study of concept formation. A lot of questions that seemed fruitless twenty or thirty years ago may now be worth another look. In fact, I feel that my story here must stop just as it begins to get really interesting. And finally, what about the magical number seven? What about the seven wonders of the world, the seven seas, the seven deadly sins, the seven daughters of Atlas in the Pleiades, the seven ages of man, the seven levels of hell, the seven primary colors, the seven notes of the musical scale, and the seven days of the week? What about the seven-point rating scale, the seven categories for absolute judgment, the seven objects in the span of attention, and the seven digits in the span of immediate memory? For the present I propose to withhold judgment. Perhaps there is something deep and profound behind all these sevens, something just calling out for us to discover it. But I suspect that it is only a pernicious, Pythagorean coincidence.},

abstract = {Information visualisation systems which generate diagrams representing discrete relational information must consider potential users if they are to be effective. Many algorithms which render an abstract graph structure as a diagram are valued for their conformance to aesthetic criteria (e.g. reducing the number of edge crossings, maximising symmetry), or for computational efficiency. They are not usually judged on their ability to produce diagrams that maximise human performance. This paper presents the results of experiments investigating the relative worth (from an HCI point of view) of graph drawing aesthetics and algorithms using a single graph. The results indicate that while some individual aesthetics affect human performance, it is difficult to say that one algorithm is `better' than another from a relational understanding point of view. Designers of automatic layout algorithms, and the systems which embody such algorithms, can benefit from this study and this human-centred approach, by adapting their methods to focus on user concerns, rather than computational ones.},

We describe our methodology and open source tools used to create the ontology. These include tools for creating ontology mappings, ontology views, detecting ontology changes and using ontologies in interfaces to enhance querying.

massively parallel sequencing to identify mutations in the genomes
of two hyperproducing strains (NG14, and its direct improved descendant,
RUT C30). We detected a surprisingly high number of mutagenic events:
223 single nucle- otides variants, 15 small deletions or insertions,
and 18 larger dele- tions, leading to the loss of more than 100 kb
of genomic DNA. From these events, we report previously undocumented
non-synonymous mutations in 43 genes that are mainly involved in
nuclear transport, mRNA stability, transcription, secretion/vacuolar
targeting, and me- tabolism. This homogeneity of functional categories
suggests that multiple changes are necessary to improve cellulase
production and not simply a few clear-cut mutagenic events. Phenotype
microarrays show that some of these mutations result in strong changes
in the carbon assimilation pattern of the two mutants with respect
to the wild-type strain QM6a. Our analysis provides genome-wide insights
into the changes induced by classical mutagenesis in a filamentous
fungus and suggests areas for the generation of enhanced T. reesei
strains for industrial applications such as biofuel production.},

@article{Waltemath11SedML,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:The increasing use of computational simulation experiments
to inform modern biological research creates new challenges to annotate,
archive, share and reproduce such experiments. The recently published
Minimum Information About a Simulation Experiment (MIASE) proposes
a minimal set of information that should be provided to allow the
reproduction of simulation experiments among users and software tools.RESULTS:In
this article, we present the Simulation Experiment Description Markup
Language (SED-ML). SED-ML encodes in a computer-readable exchange
format the information required by MIASE to enable reproduction of
simulation experiments. It has been developed as a community project
and it is defined in a detailed technical specification and additionally
provides an XML schema. The version of SED-ML described in this publication
is Level 1 Version 1. It covers the description of the most frequent
type of simulation experiments in the area, namely time course simulations.
SED-ML documents specify which models to use in an experiment, modifications
to apply on the models before using them, which simulation procedures
to run on each model, what analysis results to output, and how the
results should be presented. These descriptions are independent of
the underlying model implementation. SED-ML is a software-independent
format for encoding the description of simulation experiments; it
is not specific to particular simulation tools. Here, we demonstrate
that with the growing software support for SED-ML we can effectively
exchange executable simulation descriptions.CONCLUSIONS:With SED-ML,
software can exchange simulation experiment descriptions, enabling
the validation and reuse of simulation experiments in different tools.
Authors of papers reporting simulation experiments can make their
simulation protocols available for other scientists to reproduce
the results. Because SED-ML is agnostic about exact modeling language(s)
used, experiments covering models from different fields of research
can be accurately described and combined.},

@article{Liebermeister06,
abstract = {Background: Translating a known metabolic network into a dynamic model
requires rate laws for all chemical reactions. The mathematical expressions
depend on the underlying enzymatic mechanism; they can become quite
involved and may contain a large number of parameters. Rate laws
and enzyme parameters are still unknown for most enzymes.


Results: We introduce a simple and general rate law called "convenience
kinetics". It can be derived from a simple random-order enzyme mechanism.
Thermodynamic laws can impose dependencies on the kinetic parameters.
Hence, to facilitate model fitting and parameter optimisation for
large networks, we introduce thermodynamically independent system
parameters: their values can be varied independently, without violating
thermodynamical constraints. We achieve this by expressing the equilibrium
constants either by Gibbs free energies of formation or by a set
of independent equilibrium constants. The remaining system parameters
are mean turnover rates, generalised Michaelis-Menten constants,
and constants for inhibition and activation. All parameters correspond
to molecular energies, for instance, binding energies between reactants
and enzyme.


Conclusion: Convenience kinetics can be used to translate a biochemical
network – manually or automatically - into a dynamical model with
plausible biological properties. It implements enzyme saturation
and regulation by activators and inhibitors, covers all possible
reaction stoichiometries, and can be specified by a small number
of parameters. Its mathematical form makes it especially suitable
for parameter estimation and optimisation. Parameter estimates can
be easily computed from a least-squares fit to Michaelis-Menten values,
turnover rates, equilibrium constants, and other quantities that
are routinely measured in enzyme assays and stored in kinetic databases.},

@incollection{Wagner12,
abstract = {Since the last decade of the twentieth century, systems biology has
gained the ability to study the structure and function of genome-scale
metabolic networks. These are systems of hundreds to thousands of
chemical reactions that sustain life. Most of these reactions are
catalyzed by enzymes which are encoded by genes. A metabolic network
extracts chemical elements and energy from the environment, and converts
them into forms that the organism can use. The function of a whole
metabolic network constrains evolutionary changes in its parts. I
will discuss here three classes of such changes, and how they are
constrained by the function of the whole. These are the accumulation
of amino acid changes in enzyme-coding genes, duplication of enzyme-coding
genes, and changes in the regulation of enzymes. Conversely, evolutionary
change in network parts can alter the function of the whole network.
I will discuss here two such changes, namely the elimination of reactions
from a metabolic network through loss of function mutations in enzyme-coding
genes, and the addition of metabolic reactions, for example through
mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer. Reaction addition also
provides a window into the evolution of metabolic innovations, the
ability of a metabolism to sustain life on new sources of energy
and of chemical elements.},

@article{Sroka11,
abstract = {Background: Constraint-based approaches facilitate the prediction
of cellular metabolic capabilities, based, in turn on predictions
of the repertoire of enzymes encoded in the genome. Recently, genome
annotations have been used to reconstruct genome scale metabolic
reaction networks for numerous species, including Homo sapiens, which
allow simulations that provide valuable insights into topics, including
predictions of gene essentiality of pathogens, interpretation of
genetic polymorphism in metabolic disease syndromes and suggestions
for novel approaches to microbial metabolic engineering. These constraint-based
simulations are being integrated with the functional genomics portals,
an activity that requires efficient implementation of the constraint-based
simulations in the web-based environment.


Results: Here, we present Acorn, an open source (GNU GPL) grid computing
system for constraint-based simulations of genome scale metabolic
reaction networks within an interactive web environment. The grid-
based architecture allows efficient execution of computationally
intensive, iterative protocols such as Flux Variability Analysis,
which can be readily scaled up as the numbers of models (and users)
increase. The web interface uses AJAX, which facilitates efficient
model browsing and other search functions, and intuitive implementation
of appropriate simulation conditions. Research groups can install
Acorn locally and create user accounts. Users can also import models
in the familiar SBML format and link reaction formulas to major functional
genomics portals of choice. Selected models and simulation results
can be shared between different users and made publically available.
Users can construct pathway map layouts and import them into the
server using a desktop editor integrated within the system. Pathway
maps are then used to visualise numerical results within the web
environment. To illustrate these features we have deployed Acorn
and created a web server allowing constraint based simulations of
the genome scale metabolic reaction networks of E. coli, S. cerevisiae
and M. tuberculosis.


Conclusions: Acorn is a free software package, which can be installed
by research groups to create a web based environment for computer
simulations of genome scale metabolic reaction networks. It facilitates
shared access to models and creation of publicly available constraint
based modelling resources.},

abstract = {The concept of elementary (flux) modes provides a rigorous description
of pathways in metabolic networks and proved to be valuable in a
number of applications. However, the computation of elementary modes
is a hard computational task that gave rise to several variants of
algorithms during the last years. This work brings substantial progresses
to this issue. The authors start with a brief review of results obtained
from previous work regarding (a) a unified framework for elementary-mode
computation, (b) network compression and redundancy removal and (c)
the binary approach by which elementary modes are determined as binary
patterns reducing the memory demand drastically without loss of speed.
Then the authors will address herein further issues. First, a new
way to perform the elementarity tests required during the com- putation
of elementary modes which empirically improves significantly the
computation time in large networks is proposed. Second, a method
to compute only those elementary modes where certain reactions are
involved is derived. Relying on this method, a promising approach
for com- puting EMs in a completely distributed manner by decomposing
the full problem in arbitrarity many sub-tasks is presented. The
new methods have been implemented in the freely available software
tools FluxAnalyzer and Metatool and benchmark tests in realistic
networks emphasise the potential of our proposed algorithms.},

information about existing algorithms available for the simulation

of algorithms from simulation descriptions. Information about analogous
methods having similar characteristics and about algorithm parameters
incorporated into KiSAO is desirable for simulation tools. To retrieve

library to enable querying of the KiSA Ontology. It implements methods
to retrieve information about simulation algorithms stored in KiSAO,
their characteristics and parameters, and methods to query the algorithm
hierarchy and search for similar algorithms providing comparable
results for the same simulation set-up. Using libKiSAO, simulation
tools can make logical inferences based on this knowledge and choose
the most appropriate algorithm to perform a simulation. LibKiSAO
also enables simulation tools to handle a wider range of simulation

and can be used instead of the one indicated in the simulation description

abstract = {Background: A central problem in computational metabolic modelling is how to find biochemically plausible pathways between metabolites in a metabolic network. Two general, complementary frameworks have been utilized to find metabolic pathways: constraint-based modelling and graph-theoretical path finding approaches. In constraint-based modelling, one aims to find pathways where metabolites are balanced in a pseudo steady-state. Constraint-based methods, such as elementary flux mode analysis, have typically a high computational cost stemming from a large number of steady-state pathways in a typical metabolic network. On the other hand, graph-theoretical approaches avoid the computational complexity of constraint-based methods by solving a simpler problem of finding shortest paths. However, while scaling well with network size, graph-theoretic methods generally tend to return more false positive pathways than constraint- based methods. Results: In this paper, we introduce a computational method, ReTrace, for finding biochemically relevant, branching metabolic pathways in an atom-level representation of metabolic networks. The method finds compact pathways which transfer a high fraction of atoms from source to target metabolites by considering combinations of linear shortest paths. In contrast to current steady- state pathway analysis methods, our method scales up well and is able to operate on genome-scale models. Further, we show that the pathways produced are biochemically meaningful by an example involving the biosynthesis of inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP). In particular, the method is able to avoid typical problems associated with graph-theoretic approaches such as the need to define side metabolites or pathways not carrying any net carbon flux appearing in results. Finally, we discuss an application involving reconstruction of amino acid pathways of a recently sequenced organism demonstrating how measurement data can be easily incorporated into ReTrace analysis. ReTrace is licensed under GPL and is freely available for academic use at http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/ sysfys/software/retrace/. Conclusion: ReTrace is a useful method in metabolic path finding tasks, combining some of the best aspects in constraint-based and graph-theoretic methods. It finds use in a multitude of tasks ranging from metabolic engineering to metabolic reconstruction of recently sequenced organisms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Yarrowia lipolytica is an oleaginous yeast which has emerged
as an important microorganism for several biotechnological processes,
such as the production of organic acids, lipases and proteases. It
is also considered a good candidate for single-cell oil production.
Although some of its metabolic pathways are well studied, its metabolic
engineering is hindered by the lack of a genome-scale model that
integrates the current knowledge about its metabolism.RESULTS:Combining
in silico tools and expert manual curation, we have produced an accurate
genome-scale metabolic model for Y. lipolytica. Using a scaffold
derived from a functional metabolic model of the well-studied but
phylogenetically distant yeast S. cerevisiae, we mapped conserved
reactions, rewrote gene associations, added species-specific reactions
and inflected specialized copies of scaffold reactions to account
for species-specific expansion of protein families. We used physiological
measures obtained under lab conditions to validate our predictions.CONCLUSIONS:Y.
lipolytica iNL895represents the first well-annotated metabolic model
of an oleaginous yeast, providing a reference for future metabolic
improvement, and a starting point for the metabolic reconstruction
of other species in the Yarrowia clade and other oleaginous yeasts.},

abstract = {Background: Mathematical modelling of cellular networks is an integral
part of Systems Biology and requires appropriate software tools.
An important class of methods in Systems Biology deals with structural
or topological (parameter-free) analysis of cellular networks. So
far, software tools providing such methods for both mass-flow (metabolic)
as well as signal-flow (signalling and regulatory) networks are lacking.


Results: Herein we introduce CellNetAnalyzer, a toolbox for MATLAB
facilitating, in an interactive and visual manner, a comprehensive
structural analysis of metabolic, signalling and regulatory networks.
The particular strengths of CellNetAnalyzer are methods for functional
network analysis, i.e. for characterising functional states, for
detecting functional dependencies, for identifying intervention strategies,
or for giving qualitative predictions on the effects of perturbations.
CellNetAnalyzer extends its predecessor FluxAnalyzer (originally
developed for metabolic network and pathway analysis) by a new modelling
framework for examining signal-flow networks. Two of the novel methods
implemented in CellNetAnalyzer are discussed in more detail regarding
algorithmic issues and applications: the computation and analysis
(i) of shortest positive and shortest negative paths and circuits
in interaction graphs and (ii) of minimal intervention sets in logical
networks.


Conclusion: CellNetAnalyzer provides a single suite to perform structural
and qualitative analysis of both mass-flow- and signal-flow-based
cellular networks in a user-friendly environment. It provides a large
toolbox with various, partially unique, functions and algorithms
for functional network analysis. CellNetAnalyzer is freely available
for academic use.},

abstract = {Two divergent modelling methodologies have been adopted to increase our understanding of metabolism and its regulation. Constraint-based modelling highlights the optimal path through a stoichiometric network within certain physicochemical constraints. Such an approach requires minimal biological data to make quantitative inferences about network behaviour; however, constraint-based modelling is unable to give an insight into cellular substrate concentrations. In contrast, kinetic modelling aims to characterize fully the mechanics of each enzymatic reaction. This approach suffers because parameterizing mechanistic models is both costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we outline a method for developing a kinetic model for a metabolic network, based solely on the knowledge of reaction stoichiometries. Fluxes through the system, estimated by flux balance analysis, are allowed to vary dynamically according to linlog kinetics. Elasticities are estimated from stoichiometric considerations. When compared to a popular branched model of yeast glycolysis, we observe an excellent agreement between the real and approximate models, despite the absence of (and indeed the requirement for) experimental data for kinetic constants. Moreover, using this particular methodology affords us analytical forms for steady state determination, stability analyses and studies of dynamical behaviour.},

abstract = {Improvements in biological data acquisition and genomes sequencing
now allow to reconstruct entire metabolic networks of many living

drawing and thereby urge the need of dedicated visualization techniques.
An efficient representation of such a network should preserve the
topological information of metabolic pathways while respecting biological
drawing conventions. These constraints complicate the automatic generation
of such visualization as it raises graph drawing issues.

In this paper we propose a method to lay out the entire metabolic
network while preserving the pathway informa- tion as much as possible.
That method is flexible as it enables the user to define whether
or not node duplication should be performed, to preserve or not the
network topology. Our technique combines partitioning, node place-
ment and edge bundling to provide a pseudo-orthogonal visualization
of the metabolic network. To ease pathway information retrieval,
we also provide complementary interaction tools that emphasize relevant

abstract = {The integration of various types of genomic data into predictive models
of biological networks is one of the main challenges currently faced
by computational biology. Constraint-based models in particular play
a key role in the attempt to obtain a quantitative understanding
of cellular metabolism at genome scale. In essence, their goal is
to frame the metabolic capabilities of an organism based on minimal
assumptions that describe the steady states of the underlying reaction
network via suitable stoichiometric constraints, specifically mass
balance and energy balance (i.e. thermodynamic feasibility). The
implementation of these requirements to generate viable configurations
of reaction fluxes and/or to test given flux profiles for thermodynamic
feasibility can however prove to be computationally intensive. We
propose here a fast and scalable stoichiometry-based method to explore
the Gibbs energy landscape of a biochemical network at steady state.
The method is applied to the problem of reconstructing the Gibbs
energy landscape underlying metabolic activity in the human red blood
cell, and to that of identifying and removing thermodynamically infeasible
reaction cycles in the Escherichia coli metabolic network (iAF1260).
In the former case, we produce consistent predictions for chemical
potentials (or log- concentrations) of intracellular metabolites;
in the latter, we identify a restricted set of loops (23 in total)
in the periplasmic and cytoplasmic core as the origin of thermodynamic
infeasibility in a large sample (106) of flux configurations generated
randomly and compatibly with the prior information available on reaction
reversibility.},

abstract = {Background: Advances in bioinformatic techniques and analyses have
led to the availability of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions.
The size and complexity of such networks often means that their potential
behaviour can only be analysed with constraint-based methods. Whilst
requiring minimal experimental data, such methods are unable to give
insight into cellular substrate concentrations. Instead, the long-term
goal of systems biology is to use kinetic modelling to characterize
fully the mechanics of each enzymatic reaction, and to combine such
knowledge to predict system behaviour.


Results: We describe a method for building a parameterized genome-scale
kinetic model of a metabolic network. Simplified linlog kinetics
are used and the parameters are extracted from a kinetic model repository.
We demonstrate our methodology by applying it to yeast metabolism.
The resultant model has 956 metabolic reactions involving 820 metabolites,
and, whilst approximative, has considerably broader remit than any
existing models of its type. Control analysis is used to identify
key steps within the system.


Conclusions: Our modelling framework may be considered a stepping-stone
toward the long-term goal of a fully- parameterized model of yeast
metabolism. The model is available in SBML format from the BioModels
database (BioModels ID: MODEL1001200000) and at http://www.mcisb.org/resources/genomescale/.},

abstract = {Motivation: Structural studies of metabolic networks yield deeper
insight into topology, functionality and capabilities of the metabolisms
of different organisms. Here, we address the analysis of potential
failure modes in metabolic networks whose occurrence will render
the network structurally incap- able of performing certain functions.
Such studies will help to identify crucial parts in the network structure
and to find suitable targets for repressing undesired metabolic functions.



Results: We introduce the concept of minimal cut sets for biochemical
networks. A minimal cut set (MCS) is a minimal (irreducible) set
of reactions in the network whose inactiva- tion will definitely
lead to a failure in certain network functions. We present an algorithm
which enables the computation of the MCSs in a given network related
to user-defined object- ive reactions. This algorithm operates on
elementary modes. A number of potential applications are outlined,
including net- work verifications, phenotype predictions, assessing
structural robustness and fragility, metabolic flux analysis and
target identification in drug discovery. Applications are illustrated
by the MCSs in the central metabolism of Escherichia coli for growth
on different substrates.

@article{Jouhten09,
abstract = {Background: The filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei is an important
host organism for industrial enzyme production. It is adapted to
nutrient poor environments where it is capable of producing large
amounts of hydrolytic enzymes. In its natural environment T. reesei
is expected to benefit from high energy yield from utilization of
respirative metabolic pathway. However, T. reesei lacks metabolic
pathway reconstructions and the utilization of the respirative pathway
has not been investigated on the level of in vivo fluxes.

Results: The biosynthetic pathways of amino acids in T. reesei supported
by genome-level evidence were reconstructed with computational carbon
path analysis. The pathway reconstructions were a prerequisite for
analysis of in vivo fluxes. The distribution of in vivo fluxes in
both wild type strain and cre1, a key regulator of carbon catabolite
repression, deletion strain were quantitatively studied by performing
13C- labeling on both repressive carbon source glucose and non-repressive
carbon source sorbitol. In addition, the 13C-labeling on sorbitol
was performed both in the presence and absence of sophorose that
induces the expression of cellulase genes. Carbon path analyses and
the 13C-labeling patterns of proteinogenic amino acids indicated
high similarity between biosynthetic pathways of amino acids in T.
reesei and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In contrast to S. cerevisiae,
however, mitochondrial rather than cytosolic biosynthesis of Asp
was observed under all studied conditions. The relative anaplerotic
flux to the TCA cycle was low and thus characteristic to respiratory
metabolism in both strains and independent of the carbon source.
Only minor differences were observed in the flux distributions of
the wild type and cre1 deletion strain. Furthermore, the induction
of the hydrolytic gene expression did not show altered flux distributions
and did not affect the relative amino acid requirements or relative
anabolic and respirative activities of the TCA cycle.

Conclusion: High similarity between the biosynthetic pathways of amino
acids in T. reesei and yeast S. cerevisiae was concluded. In vivo
flux distributions confirmed that T. reesei uses primarily the respirative
pathway also when growing on the repressive carbon source glucose
in contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which substantially diminishes
the respirative pathway flux under glucose repression.},

abstract = {The research by the information visualization community (“ Info Viz
”) shows clearly that using a visual representation of data-sets
enables faster analysis by the end users. Several scientific reasons
explain these results. First of all, the visual perception system
is the most powerful of all the human perception systems. In the
human brain, 70\% of the receptors and 40\% of the cortex are used
for the vision process [ 27 , 34 ]. Furthermore, human beings are
better at “recognition” tasks than at “memorization” tasks [ 10 ].
This implies that textual representations are less efficient than
visual metaphors when one wants to analyze huge data-sets. This comes
from the fact that reading is both a memorization task and a recognition
task.},
